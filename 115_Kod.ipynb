      "['yes   it s early access    yes   it s get a lot of promise    great graphic   amazing environment   killer first hour or so    and then your ship crash and you find yourself in the most generic rpg of        bland character   insultingly generic story quest   unbalanced repetitive combat   nightmare of inventory management   atrocious load time    those be all fundamental issue that be far beyond bug and glitch and crash you d expect from an alpha title    in your first battle   combat seem to have so much depth   so many class   ability   item   a few combat later   and it s yet another slog of range miss while the entire battlefield and everyone on it be on fire    the intro mission be so fresh   awesome baddie   incredible setting   and then bam   you re right back to find yourself shipwreck on a beach   I wish I be kid   and fight goblin and bandit in a cave    there s so much to the world   so much that you get overwhemle with a million unmarked container everywhere you have to individually click on to find out that they re either empty or contain another five carrot and two sausage   a few hour in   your inventory be overflow with book and key you have no idea if you ll ever need again and other crap you have no idea where you d sell for useless gold since no vendor have anything decent for sale   and scroll and potion and poison and arrow and ring and necklace and possibly quest item but who know if they re ever go to be useful   soon enough you begin to neglect inventory management completely because on top of everything the ux be atrocious and basic task like equip item or read letter for exposition or eat potato for hp be an almost masochistic experience where the game seem almost deliberate in hide relevant information and closing screen from under you    the dialogue be cinematic   but skill check be completely break   not to mention do by someone with zero understanding of d d mechanic and    or basic math   add an integer to a random roll and compare to a target value be not the same as subtract that integer from the target value    so a few dialogue in   you re quick save before each conversation   then reload when the roll fail and redo the dialogue again   and the reload time be painfully long and after watch the loading too many time you no long care which way skill check go   and suddenly you re in combat all the time    the world be so large and open   and then you sneak into a location and break a quest flow yet again   which you only realize an hour later   and the second or third time you ponder restore an ancient save and retrace your step   and realize everything s become a chore    and so you begin to realize that issue in this game be not merely cosmetic or the lack of polish   generic bland dialogue   cookie cutter character   and tired cliche mission you ve play in every rpg since       aren t   early access    they re here to stay   find the miss duke and return a steal shipment without look in the chest   that s the aaa rpg experience we ve all be wait for   combat be a bore because while multi facete on paper   in reality          facet of that million be so tiny they get

the character dialogue    the amount of effort that have be put into this game be undeniable   but I think the   modern   way of animate character dialogue as they do here take away a huge amount of immersion to this game   in old crpgs I could imagine the dialogue myself   because read the text be like read a book   that be   at least to I   a huge part of the appeal of these game   and also of read book    but now everything be animate   so there s no room for imagination anymore    I don t know why they choose this route   maybe its because a new   modern game have to use new   modern technology   maybe a modern baldurs gate have to cater to a wide mass of people   young people who be not willing to read through huge wall of text anymore    but to I this be a huge game killer   if the character dialogue be at least well do   again   I can see the effort be put in there with motion capturing etc   but the result just doesn t look very good   many time I can not read the facial expression of the character in the cutscene   be they smile   I see their mouth go     but sometimes I m still not sure    other time the facial expression be just too much   as if they want to make absolutely sure you know what it be they want to express   it s like watch a camp movie   full of bad acting   I don t believe it s the actor fault   but the translation from motion capture into the game engine   how it look in its final form be just horrible      I would honestly prefer wall of text over this   hope it will get well until final release but I don t think so   until then I can not

here be my review    I see this game a year ago and be hesitant to try it due to the turn base combat and have absolutely no prior experience with d d   I give in recently due to want a new game to play   and oh boy be I wrong   this be truly a masterpiece   the level of depth in this game be insane   it have completely change my perspective on this style of game and d d as a whole    at first   the abundance of option during character creation truly overwhelm I   result in I spend    hour on it alone   but I m glad it s there because it just make it that much more replayable   this level of choice continue throughout the game   ensure your experience be what you want it to be    most of these long story game end up tire I out   so I just rush through to the end to not feel like I ve waste the time I spend on it already   bg   be an exception to that   despite be the long game out of all of they   I truly enjoy the whole journey    before I even finish the game   I already couldn t wait to do another playthrough with mod and different choice   now that I have finish the game   I can confidently say that the feeling hasn t change   and I ll be do another playthrough in the future   probably an evil one   ', 'sex with shadowheart    ', 'original review below    I be wrong   this game be fantastic   lot of feel   lot s of incredible combat    not write more   need to get back to play      this be a really hard decision for I   I ve look forward to this game for month   I m a big d d fan and do   fan    I binge the game obsessively when it come out and I slow down and come back to it to enjoy my time with it and it be a good game for ea    there be nothing about this review which be base on ea problem   which be why I be not recommend it   it be a good game   graphic great   combat great    I m not recommend it for one sad reason   the game doesn t feel like a d d game to I   it doesn t invoke or inspire a sense of wonder or like I be in the world at all   a lot of the complaint be how similar it be to dos   and I agree   it feel like an expansion from that    even with the broad race   and the lore   there be a book about phandelvor I absolutely love   I just feel isolated and cut off from the adventure   maybe this will change but in     hour   I never get the sense of wonder of adventure   I get in any of the original baldur gate and that be with the annoyance of thac     this didn t feel like my quest   the game do a great job of create urgency but it take away a degree of player agency in favour of shallow action   I d compare it to an action film where after     minute you come out of it wonder what the hell be the point of the whole thing   do you enjoy yourself sure   would you watch it again   maybe in a few year when drunk    if you be look for a good rpg game this be definitely go to be the game for you   it will definitely be a great game   but right now   it do not feel like a baldurs gate game or even a d d game   it feel shallow and that s not anything to do with early access   it s how similar it feel to dos   and how it fail to really go far with the immersion    this might be an unfair review but having recently play solasta crown of the magister   a game by a much small company   there I feel like I be play a d d game   it lack a lot of the great thing this game have but it get the   feel   of the game right    so that s my take for larian   I need more   feel     regardless of this review   I will keep play as it develop and I be open to change this review as it develop and I be still excited about it    but as it stand   I can t recommend it   in it s current state    for those who get this far   I salute you', 'great game so far but do not purchase until full release   I think an   early

this game because I think the perspective in which you play the game would bother I   I have never play a d d game before    but I be really crave for a rpg game that would have an interesting story   where e g my choice would make impact on other npc and you can form relationship with they   recruit your own team etc    I must say that I fall in love with it and I have play the game way more than what steam show   the story first of all be so good   and all of the character feel very unique   the music in the game be fantastic   the quest be also fun to do   and see the reaction of your teammate when you make certain choice   even though the game be in early acce I already feel so immersed in the game   I never think I would love this kind of playstyle but I really do   so this be exactly the game I be look for and I m addicted lol    and also on another note   yes I m simpe for astarion idgaf     please release more content soon I m go to die    mind you   I never simp for

as        it s mondo early access   truly    also to put it bluntly   this be the most stylistically   both in term of visual audio design and story   pleasing d d game I ve ever play   the reverberate thud when you cast eldritch blast and see this white hot beam of force energy throw an enemy across the map be just insanely pleasing and exhilarate in a way I can t put into word   the game look great   sound great   and when it s do it ll probably be one of my favorite game I ll have ever play   let alone an exemplary d d title    but right now   it s just too bugged for I to play it   certain dialogue option or choice crash the game   there s miss content   like class   location   tutorial for some of the more wonky mechanic like go back to your campsite    there s visual glitch all over the place   and it run a little haggardly   but that be say everything I ve see from larian suggest they re pour their heart and soul into this thing   it s an insanely ambitious game   they actually want to   functionally   fully port   e into a an old style party base rpg   complete with passive perception check    passive insight   the ability to just say        it   to the plot and use your rogue to snipe a sketchy guy with dialogue option from across the map instead of talk to he in classic skyrim style   which be something that pillar of eternity and divinity original sin don t really allow    and of course not only combat derivative but narritavely derivative tpk s for when you talk to the wrong guy   say the wrong thing   or try relate to the wrong ulithirid and get shank because you fail your passive perception check to notice the assassin s creed style wrist blade   it s the most alive crpg I ve ever play and it s obvious the team both not only have crazy goal but also the mean and talent to accomplish they    this game be insanely creative and I really think will be genera define   when it emerge from early access   if you re a hardcore d d fan you ll love the game as it be now   especially with the patch a few day ago which I think fix many of the thing I just speak about   but you win t be disappoint in wait for release   I will be   easy      I ve spend since buy the   e player s handbook and dungeon master s guide    tl dr   if you re a roleplay nerd you will go           crazy over this game   it s functionally a port of   e but like   insanely well do    but wait for it s full release   it s buggy as       currently and the bug impact the narrative   they re not simply visual', 'my first d d experience and I m enjoy it a lot   the character be just insanely well write   however   I would prefer a little more guidance as the mechanic be quite overwhelming at first   especially the combat mechanic    multiplayer be a lot of fun

the bg series   but   I do not expect it to over take disco elysium as my favourite crpg   how this game react to your character and their choice be unequalled   I can not think of another game that allow this much freedom and choice    this game make I feel selfish and greedy   for any change or modification I would want   because it already do so much    I play a heroic elf scoundrel   whose maintain the moral high ground cause many issue    I play a dark urge half orc who wallow in his depravity    and I play as astarian   redone as a monk   and play as an anti hero    it really feel like they be three different game that happen to hit some of the same beat and scene    if you be big in to rpgs and freedom of choice in they   give in to your own dark urge and grab this game     ea

capture the tabletop rpg experience of d d unlike any game I have play in sometime    wonderful graphic   many choice   and obvious replay value   this be a classic in the making    the only thing

and a dog and no time    then I read the tweet   you know the one   the prominent game developer who say that we can not allow larian to define our expectation of rpgs   oh   really   I immediately buy the game and spend hour download it out of pure   unadulterated spite    I be    hour in   three   I be blow away   I spend the first hour create my character   I pull out my dungeon    dragon

don t care about sound design    I ve misclicke so many time   there s so much to click   I ve die in so many way   there be so many way to die   there be so many bug   but I don t even care because in a game as complex and deep as this   you re go to experience lot and lot of fun    larian   you ve do it   you ve make a game so incredible that other developer be banding together to warn we not to play your magnum opus or we win t enjoy the next stranger thing click quest game or whatever garbage they re shovel out    I can not wait to spend day in baldur s gate         edit           after      hour     since this review get some attention   let I give you an update after about     hour of early access   my initial review be   obviously   hyperbolic   but that be my real time reaction to find a truly great game in a genre and style that I think have be abandon by game producer who be more interested in game as service   micro transaction and shooter    the good review of bg   I could give be that this be the game I ve be hope for since dragon age   origin   I play game for system   not so much story   and I really like both the system and the story of this game   if I really like a game   I look forward to start over and try something new   I play xcom    and dwarf fortress a little bit    this game also scratch that itch   which seem strange to say about a story drive rpg   but it really be a game that encourage you to experiment    as it stand   on the verge of release   this game be a        for I and in my pantheon of favorite     I don t work for larian or have anything to do with they other than play d os  ', 'I have alot on my mind   and well   in it', 'always trust volo   especially with surgery', 'tldr   with a heavy heart   I must admit that I be not have a good time   but you might    tldr    if you enjoy the crpg genre   this game be almost certainly for you    and I m surprised you haven t buy it yet in light of its near universal acclaim   why be you read this     I buy this game on the back of the universally positive reception   I can see why it have its stellar reputation     with a caveat   if you haven t be able to get into crpgs in the past due to the various dice base system   but see the review and think that this product might transcend your expectation   I think you will be disappoint   primarily due to the prevalence of a large number of dice roll that can instantly kill you or wipe your party    I start off have a great time   the world be carefully craft   the character I ve meet be interesting and well write   there be so many option give to the player when wander the world   from use ability to talk to animal or corpse to gain special advantage or insight   to   expect for this genre   skullduggery of sneak   pickpocketing   and lockpicke your way to success    unfortunately   as I start to get far into act     I start getting kill by the dice   repeatedly   I find an enemy lie on the ground wound and   though the game do warn I approach be dangerous   I be curious about what I might be able to learn from they   the game throw a dice roll at I that I fail   and my character be immediately kill   force a reload   I hadn t save in awhile   so I lose some progress   no big deal   I ve learn my lesson   I think to myself   I ll just save more frequently so that I don t lose so much progress like that again   so I approach the situation differently the next time and avoid death    hour of gameplay pass in act     I be still have a decent time   and I be especially have fun talk to people   use my persuasion and clever wit to gain advantage and access new content   I scrape past some difficult fight with enemy that I think be fairly challenging   and I ve have to reload after mismanage a fight or fail to take something into account    then the fight get hard   and hard   and hard   enemy vastly outnumber you   each enemy get their own dice to roll against you   more dice against you mean they re go to roll more critical success   which they do   frequently   I encounter a fight near a cave in act     the first time I enter the area   my party be wipe on the first round   the second time I be wipe on the first round   it keep happen   critical success roll give to enemy with multiple attack would kill my character in a single turn   I try to prioritize the heavy hitter   but could not do enough damage before they d wipe my party in short order   I give up and try to approach the fight from a different angle   I be able to initiate dialog and get one of the tough enemy on my side through my social and magical ability   and barely squeak out a victory    all the enemy dead   this party member be not my   designate talker    fail his dice roll   and be attack   several of my other character   wound or die   be unable to assist   my party be wipe   game over   the fight have last nearly an hour   I d need to reload a save again   I realize I be not enjoy be kill by the dice   I feel no desire to repeat the endeavor   I close the game   and I now leave this review    I might revisit the game again sometime   but I suspect that this type of game be just not for I   I don t have the experience with dice base combat that could help I succeed in situation like this   and I find the experience so punish that I do not have any desire to   get good   constantly reload save to try and figure out what I be suppose to do to progress   I desperately want to experience more of this game s writing   narrative   and interesting choice   but they feel inaccessible to I   gate behind tactical dice base combat that be punish and cruel    my understanding be that in actual d d session   a good gm be responsible for ensure the player enjoy themselves   in spite of the challenge they be present   I do not feel like there be a good gm behind the scene   I feel a cold calculate computer   loom over I with murderous intent   force I to reload save      hour and fifty quicksave later   I be put this game down   disappoint   and can t offer a recommendation to any of my friend who aren t already in love with crpgs', 'I butcher a group of refugee in

few time where the game itself essentially state that we be save the world from a god like threat   the pacing in act    be terrible    it feel like two act smushe into one   I know it win goty   but I would say   at present state it be        which be not bad   but I still hope for more update definitive edition hopefully a full blow expansion in the future', 'astarion be a walk red flag but I

play a game call dragon age origin   an rpg set in a fantasy world with magic and the like   where you could form a party with other character from the world    there be this one time where I be in a tower full of mage that be be attack by monster   or something like that   my party find a group of mage who have take shelter in one of the room inside the tower and my evil witch companion suggest kill they all for be coward   be an edgy teenager and roleplay as an evil edgy half elf wizard   I obviously agree   so we get to do a little magicicide and keep go our way   clear the tower   finish the game a long while after   and that be that    I enjoy the game so much I start a new playthrough   get to the mage s tower and find this group again   but this time I decide to help they instead of give they a ticket to the afterlife and   to my surprise   it turn out one of the mage   an old woman   could become one of your companion   she have ton of dialogue   a personal quest   a personal story to tell   my decision of be an edgelord and slaughter a bunch of mage cause I to miss a possible companion   and the game be full of situation when your action would impact your character and the world around you   one of my companion leave my party near the end of the game because I spare a guy he hate   in one playthrough   I d ally myself with a group werewolve and kill a settlement elve so I could have they in my army for the final fight   in the other I d help the elf cleanse the werewolf of their curse   lose they as ally but befriend the elf   you could help people in distress or make matter bad   and the world would continue on   and this be true for the whole game    I search a long time for a game that could give I that same feeling   of be in a world that doesn t give you the   right   or   wrong   path   but simply choice and consequence   but none would do it   not the other dragon age game   nor mass effect   nor the witcher   nor thepathfinder game   and I eventually give up   think that I be see dao through rose tint glass   the special feeling I have be no more than nostalgia    ten year or so from that   I play baldur s gate     and I finally feel I be play dao for the first time all over again    this game account for everything   and I mean    every single conflict can be solve in a multitude of way   whether you play the hero or the villain   the way in which you can act can vary depend on how you get to the place   your character s class   your race   your past action   your companion   your character skill   and it doesn t matter what you decide to do   the game keep go   the world change to fit the consequence of your action   the big example of this be that   be in early access   I can t talk much about the story   but what we have so far be really promise   each companion be wonderfully voice act   and they all have interesting backstorie and quest that you may only get to see if they approve of you enough    combat feel amazing even though it can be a little slow at time   be turn base and lack rtwp as an option   every hit carry a lot of weight   and most of the spell look and sound incredible   larian s do a pretty good job at adapt the d d   e rule to a video game format   also   the music be fantastic overall    right now   the full game be two month from be release   and I m hope the finished product have the

mostly for individual who wish to support larion financially during the development of the game   or to play test bug report to help with larion s usage statistic and polish of the game    every

'a target image of rpgs   limit by shortcoming of unrestrained scope   want to love this game   I love pc rpgs   have play bg        play their early game do    I play d d irl   in many way its good in class at what it do   and I hope it inspire just as grand competition    baldur gate    will feel great in the beginning   but once you get deep into the game the shortcoming become clear     the gameplay be exemplary   I have never play a turn base roleplay game where everything feel as fluid as bg    other rpgs that I find to have much more engaging writing   like one of my favourite   tyranny   by obsidian   fall short when it come to actually play the game and take out your enemy   a challenge task give the complexity of tie   e together into a cohesive experience   a    with all your dungeon    dragon fifth edition core option   you will be able to customise to a level rarely see   this be a double edge sword   which I will come back to   moreover    the graphic be oftentime breathtake   forget a few texture   you can recognise detailed facial expression   give emotional depth to the game   the close camera angle give you a much more immersive experience     the game experience much of the same issue as the last game larian make    divinity original sin      where the game start great   cool character customisation   innovative option   high detail clarity in appearance   only to break down once you get halfway through the game   it feel like many of the decision you make along the way   ultimately do not matter that much   or at all   talk to your companion give you a few line to say which you deplete rapidly   not say every game need to be at a level of write similar to   discord elysium    but the problem be when there be no writing at all   nothing to say besides a single option   go back home    with nothing more to say   you can not reflect on the monster you just kill   or the people you just save   or the dilemma you decide   with exception for specific time    it feel weird exhaust the dialogue option within a few minute   only to have nothing to say to people you walk with for span of time afterwards   feel like they be just there to provide a combat role   not to be your parasocial friend imitation   how they react be quite linear   do enough action they like   few they dislike   then they will bed you as the relation bar go up   not care particularly about what you say   compare to other notable rpgs where dialogue impact how your relation turn out to be   there be limited character development   if at all   except for situation present with a dilemma with one obvious preferred choice    little thought seem to have be put into the evil route   you lose out of quest   the well gear   companion   its just a bad experience with less content   I would think an evil route could tempt you with well option   with the disadvantage that you leech parasitically to a bad ending   with few friend   they should learn from the vast library there be out there of villainy   take into account   the game be thus mostly linear   even if it give the illusion of otherwise   in other word   whimsically do side quest and save people    saint   go about your own life not care for a village or two during your supposedly pressed for time due to threat of imminent death situation    evil   it seem like a crime that in order to experience the game more fully in a completionism matter   you must work against your immersion of time stress   a break incentive   at least skyrim doesn t claim you to be evil if depend on whether you postpone the main quest to do finish guild mission   as for your   nemesis    I generally prefer antagonist you develop some sort of personal relation with   possibly with some plot twist along the way   somewhat spoiler    I fear that they release their game too soon   thus   it be too late to make structural change   their game do   be not fix in the same way either   where they opt to just remove romance in the definitive edition rather than fix the bug   give the enormous number of sale bg   have          I presume it be more likely that they will afford to labour their love for long   develop their game much more      they should have remove most character customisation   class   race   only to focus on one in depth story   if you choose the class warlock   where you serve a patron   that relationship should be the pivotal point of the game   not just an extra encounter once or twice to check a box   I want to feel like my class   my race   my background   actually make a significant role   the game give you the illusion that your class matter   like when you be use the   speak with dead   spell to get   vital   info from corpse   only to find out the same info in a note on a drawer so that a different class could complete the quest as well   render your spell preparation quite a pointless effort   in other word   class mostly change the way combat work   but it feel like a disconnect when it do not affect the story   it should be obvious that a master swordsman fighter   compare to an arch mage   would have quite different possible outcome for a task   but here its distil into slash with a sword or deal the same damage with a ball of fire   like a theme skin with some tactical value   it be a bit ironic that such a customisable experience   offer almost no real impact from your decision   thus I would prefer a   baldur gate    warlock   baldur gate    wizard   tailor experience    I do love that the customisation exist   as it give quite the modding potential for a tailor story   and work as a sandbox engine for either multiplayer with friend or learn d d   e   but for the main story it work against the plot   I would rather be force to play a specific class for bg    other than what I would normally be   then wait for a sequel to use a different one   or they could have go for the diablo way   where the game be mostly combat focus so that the customisation do not hinder the experience   but at that point then most of what bg   try to do go down the drain       if you love the combat aspect of dungeon    dragon   e   or if you want to learn how the system work   then give baldur gate    a go   if you expect some grand intricate story influence by the choice you make   where you develop personal relation with companion

have be in early access since            and will remain in ea until   wait for it   sometime in             year    now I m willing to wait and I m glad we ve get something but if you re expect a full game for full price the sting on the ea spanking will leave your wallet   and probably the cheek behind the pocket you keep it in   a little raw   if you ll allow some devil s advocate       for the final version of this game be probably more than fair   exceedingly so in fact   in the meantime though   it s effectively just the begging of the game   albeit several hour of it   and you pay full price for it with the promise that it ll go full release in the future    larian studio be pretty cool though and I highly doubt they ll go bust before drop the early access tag   still   though

a much deserve replay   since then   I can honestly say thing have improve   a lot of the big issue   at least the one that weren t hard code in   be address    this game still have a lot of design

character with tragic back story because every single one of they have it to an overly cliched degree   they re not just wacky and amusing comic relief   they re not just simple knight or paladin look to prove themselves through deed and act of valor   or anything else that would feel like a natural part of the world   while it s nice that every character can be romance   those dialogue option really just hit you over the head   you can t just be nice to they to retain their loyalty   you have to either be a complete douche or sweep they off their foot   which just lead to a lot of uncomfortable situation that just border sexual harassment   apparently larian think people can t just be friend   they always have to be lover   but maybe that s just because I m try to focus on the

the glitch and only a single chapter it s hard to say the game be worth it in its current state   I would say to purchase divinity and play through those series in the meantime     edit    with everything that I have see be add or go to be add in full release later this week I absolutely recommend get this game   even more so that multiple aaa game company be scared of this masterpiece of a release   I have not be as excited for a game like this in year and I likely win t be for more to come after this   I truly hope that this game scare other company into stop their pos money hungry tactic and actually finish game without the need for         dlc for a complete game experience   by far the good game to have be release in recent year', 'baldur s gate    baldur s gate    be a massive rpg produce by larian studio   know for other adventure and tactical game   knowledge of the previous part of the baldur s gate series be not require   the game explain everything in a clear and friendly way for a new player   the game be in theory a finished product   but I see some cut content here   so I expect we will see a huge amount of new thing when larian release the free definitive edition of this game   the plot we start the plot in a very interesting way   on the ship of the game s main villain   this be a game s segment that   while heavily influence by fantasy   be also largely sci fi   and the fusion of these genre work out great here   no matter what character class we choose at the beginning   what race and gender   our adventure will look different   and our possible decision will change   the character creator itself be really good   and it allow you to present what you have in mind incredibly accurately   from a very huge pool of possibility   branching decision appear even in the simple of side quest   and in the main one they can significantly change the gameplay plot   so we can have potentially thousand of well spend hour of fun here   each conversation and confrontation can be use and resolve in different way   lead we to different event   character and even location   the story itself be very interesting and arouse our curiosity   but as with game like this   the big part of push the story forward be our companion   each of they very different from each other   they have different comment on each situation   and different ambition   it s a real pleasure to interact with they   especially if we enter into a romance with they   this game be basically a secret date simulator   so we have a huge amount of opportunity when it come to build close relationship with each of the character   I have to commend the very well do facial expression and animation of every npc in the game   which give a lot of context to each conversation   and simply make each conversation more engaging to listen and watch   we start the game by create our character   go through race   gender   class   sub class and statistic selection   but the most original part of it all be the second character creator   where we create the character of our own   guardian    this be pretty much the same as before   but we only encounter this character in vision and dream trigger by use a specific power during gameplay   this character be very important to the plot   and be one of the game s big plot twist   a really well write character   like every character in this game   even the pet have interesting dialogue   I say this because depend on our class   skill and item   we can talk to the dead and animal   so it open up a huge window to explore not so obvious dialogue and decision   as for the world and exploration   the world be divide into a few separate map   each completely different from each other   with really great quest and brilliantly design location   this be one of the few game that doesn t even have to force we to explore   the process itself be so enjoyable that we do it ourselves with enthusiasm   during our exploration   we see our team from above at a slight angle   which   together with the turn base nature of baldur s gate     give a really great strategic value   along with interesting skill for we and each of our companion to observe and use   the game be also full of small riddle and puzzle   this be a true reflection of the d d game formula   in the form of a video game   there s even a dice rolling system   and I have pretty mixed feeling about it   dice roll appear during conversation to use specific skill like persuasion   cunning   intelligence   strength   etc   if the number on the dice be great than or equal to the require number   we succeed   and if it be less   we fail to use the skill or convince the character   and here come the problem in the form that player will try to check every dialogue possibility   and due to the unpredictable nature of the dice and our success   we sometimes have to load the save game several time to succeed   and the loading screen in this game be kinda long in some place   it s a nice system overall   but it do spoil the flow of the game a bit   not to mention our freedom to make specific decision   during the ea phase I have a lot of problem with stability   but with the official release of the full game and the massive amount of commitment from the side of the developer   now the game run incredibly smoothly and stable   and I have no problem with it   which be good   because when it come to effect and graphic   the game it be incredibly pretty and full of detail   the vas in this game do a truly phenomenal job recording dialogue line for their character   everyone contribute something interesting   and there be no character in this game that would be difficult to listen to   you can see that everyone give it their all   and of course   the music   the music in this game be fantastic   one of the good I ve ever hear   in quieter place and in the character creator itself   the music be incredibly pleasant and relax   so it be the perfect game to release the tension after a hard day   however   during fight scene   the game have a very dynamic soundtrack reflect who we be fight against   give each fight a very epic   cinematic tone   a brilliant game   fill to the brim with great content for thousand of hour without the possibility of get bore   this be   in my opinion   an example of what game should be   and it should definitely be the standard of the gaming industry in the future   the excuse make by other   even large studio   that bg   have an unrealistic production value be the big           excuse for be lazy in the history   one of the good game I ve ever play   and definitely deserve goty', 'edit   I m change this to positive because larian   finally   over the last    patch have address the height and backstab issue I outline below so that neither deal with advantage disadvantage   I m very happy for the change though surprise it take almost a year to get in   they have implement other various change base on community suggestion which be great to see   it s still early access   there be still a lot of work to do   game really need to feel snappy before release    but it s look good   I m go to leave my old review below because it help remind we how much have change since that time    original   the game be fun   have a lot of potential   and will   already have   make a ton of money    would I recommend it   no   not yet    sure   it s ea   and there be lot of poor implementation   the ui   inventory management   camera control   party control   which be horrendous right now   but they ll probably be improve   I m much more worried about path larian have actively decide to go down    larian have make some very questionable deviation away from the d d rule set which in turn trivialize a lot of what make d d what it be   I be in no way advocate for anything near a       adaptation   that be silly because many aspect of the d d rule be adapt for the table top don t need to be translate to a crpg   but what they ve do will only snowball   there be far too many thing to list   and I would suggest you take a look at their forum to get a glance   but I ll share one of the most jarring one    they grant advantage disadvantage base on elevation to your opponent   or simply stand behind they   for ranged character and elevation   this mean every fight you spend a little movement to climb some ladder   or you position up there pre combat    for melee character   it mean you spend a small part of your movement to simply walk around the enemy you be already fight   it s an incredibly cheap cost to get a very strong bonus   the real issue be that there be a lot of ability already in d d that give impose advantage disadvantage   all of these become much bad   often pointless when you can get it in such an easy way   it take away from class feature   it remove the risk reward tactical choice you d normally have to make   it just invalidate so much of d d   right now the level cap be    in ea   within d d   there be     ability spell condition that can be use by level    to grant impose advantage or disadvantage   how be it go to feel when you get one of these only to realize you ll never use it   why use reckless attack   I might as well just walk behind the enemy   who doesn t ever walk behind you     on top of that   the game really feel like another divinity   original sin     mountain of consumable    ability to cheese the game without any regard for class role    hundred of empty container   walk into a room and spend    minute just search for nothing    the response so far from larian have basically be non existent   no one be expect daily update or communication   but when the only communication be deliver every couple of week via patch note with zero mention of the feedback they re receive   it feel pretty bad    all that say   I hope larian turn this ship in the right direction   I would be thrill to come back and change this review', 'my work be really cut into my baldur s gate    time   should I quit', 'my personal experience and impression so far   in the meantime   I be play via geforce now so that I can have high graphic quality and do recording   I m also in act     what I write here remain true for I   it s get well and well if anything    but I may have to overhaul the whole review at a point    the following certainly have influence my experience   I play bg    bg    iwd   ps t and nwn   with expansion all within the last year   so the memory be relatively fresh   all I know about d d   e be from idle champion   in the meantime   I learn a few thing   while some say it be not recommend   I be do my first playthrough with the dark urge background and the intent to resist as hard as I can   with this background   you not only have some dark force inside you   but also wake up in your pod cover with blood   remember nothing but your name   for I   this intensify the experience    I be utterly confuse with the spell system at first   I perfectly understand prepared spell and spell slot   but I still confuse this at the beginning and then wonder why I couldn t cast anymore       same with the control     the latter I resolve by adjust the key binding a bit   I automatically hit spacebar when I have to think about my next move   q or g when something dangerious may be ahead and       I also have technical problem   because I be play on a low end laptop   if you consider buy   keep in mind that bg   be resource heavy   there be workaround for old machine   there be useful guide   get tip from friend and make a video about how to be able to play with the graphic still look nice and without too much lag    the big mistake you can make be compare bg   to any other game or expect it to be the same experience as any other game   it s a different game   with a different ruleset   with different combat mechanic   and comparison only will ruin your experience   good approach it with an open mind    just love the graphic   it be all so detailed   and in my opinion they do a great job with the facial expression in cutscene   how they change    it may lead to your character look totally different   but so be it    the music   the atmosphere     spell and spell effect also be nice   personally   I like how spell be cast by say what they be suppose to do in latin and a lot of gesture      there be very dark moment   for the background I choose   at least    then again some more light hearted   normal   adventure   where you can explore the beautiful landscape   grab everything that isn t nail down   go treasure hunting and or enter a dungeon    it may be only I   but from the beginning   I see reminder of other game all over the place   the way how something be describe   some specific phrase   even have one or the other wtf wrong game   moment   it s in the detail   there definitely be reference to bg   and     you can find book which mention character and event from these game   there also be tiny little detail you will only notice when you either play the old game or know a lot about d d lore   include the faer nian pantheon and the history of the game world s     maybe they overdo it with the skill check   the rngod rule here   can be annoying or frustrating at time   when the dice decide a bit too much   on the other hand   these can lead to funny situation which give a certain tabletop feel   when you fail at what you be good at   but succeed at what you be bad at   or when the wizard without perception bonus detect a trap first   make I laugh a couple time    there also be some philosophical moment   if you explore everything carefully   interact with everything   talk to everyone and everything and read all the book   not only do it show that the designer know their lore   it also may raise a few question if you think about it   you even can encounter an npc early on who ask you a philosophical question   have a very emotional moment here   also because     my poor character     almost pick the second option   spoiler warning      you can play this game for the combat part   which can be fun   or for the story or for both   I find thorough exploration and have an eye for detail most rewarding   as for combat   can be fun   there be so many different thing you can do and try      it appear that you can confuse the ai a bit by do something unexpected   I be able to beat a group of enenmie of at least level    and large than my level    group without a fighter in my team   I be play only on balanced   but still     be fun      I be still very early in the game and don t know what be yet to come   I still may end up disappointed or find myself unable to win a battle or otherwise get stuck or frustrate   I certainly hope not    as I only have see a small fraction of the game and   as I already say   the experience be a personal one   this recommendation be to be take with a grain of salt', 'what an amazing adventure this game take I on   it leave I stunned at how in depth and beautiful it be through and through   I look forward to see all that bg   have in store for my many planned character    congratulation larian   you have make a wonderful world for we all to enjoy', 'so I should preface that I really love divinity original sin     and larian as a whole   this isn t mean to be mean   or to be an attack on the creator of bg    nor the people that like it   it s my opinion on   the   issue that the game have   I hope it change   but I acknowledge that it likely win t    I like   e   I like divinity original sin     the system for each be fun in their own right   but this feel like   e be paste onto do   and I don t think   e really work within the framework of a single player video game   at the end of the day the system revoke player agency   your rp choice don t matter   your attention to detail don t matter   your combat plan don t matter   everything be down to the roll of dice    regardless of your capability as a player there be   always   a chance at failure   in a tabletop environment   play with other people this be fine   it add to the narrative be construct as you play   you adapt   your fellow player adapt   and the gm adapt as you succeed and fail   this isn t a group tabletop environment   this be a single player video game    it be far from rewarding to pay attention to the game   but be deny option because I fail passive skill check   it be far from rewarding when I m be deny role play choice because I fail skill check   it be far from rewarding when I use the environment and my party as effectively as possible   but I get critical failure after critical failure    everything be up to chance   and in the end   there be little to no agency that can truly be find in the game    now   one might say that the failure add to your personal story    but again   there be no agency give to the player for those failure   no amount of bonus can guarantee success and so when you fail something that you build your character for   or have be role play toward it doesn t feel like you bring the failure onto yourself   but rather the rng system of the game randomly decide that you fail   what s bad be that random chance can end up decide your xp gain   and attitude change from companion    this system of decide success   both through active and passive roll   really and truly remove the agency that be feel in do   and the tabletop rpg genre    everything that make   e what it be   include the reliance on chance to decide success and failure require the tabletop environment to be viable and fun   even then   gms can decide to wave dice roll if they deem the roll unnecessary   ie player take note   be attentive   or roleplay well   you can t do any of that in a video game   and so very core of the game play just doesn t work here in this format    because of what ultimately feel genuinely unrewarding system that flippantly punish the player base solely on the result of a random number generator and that there be no human arbitrator actively participate in the result of those roll I can not in good conscious recommend this game to anyone    if you want to play a modern   immersive rpg then go play divinity original sin     if you want to play a baldur s gate game then play bg   or bg    if you want the tabletop experience then find an online group    I truly hope that they gut the d    system out of bg   before launch   or allow player a choice between the   e system and that of do    it be upsetting to say as a fan of larian   dungeon    dragon   the genre   and the setting     but I regret buy baldur s gate     at least for the full price it be at the time', '        hour on early

 but as the time go   gosh    she be amazing and I want to support her   her ending be somehow the most satisfying one for I    I love how they make a lot of reference about bg   and     I have research it before play bg    and karlach be fangirl of the previous event be the good   all of these writing   you could tell that they do it really from the heart with care    if you already play crpg   especially from larian studio like do    you know that there be not only    or    to do your quest   there be a lot of possibility to finish it and also the consequence     I really didn t know anything about dungeon and dragon mechanic when I first start   I just know that it be play by dice with     side on it and    other dice   and nothing more   but after play this game   I somehow know one or two about it   even when I watch high roller dnd session with bg   cast   I know what they need to do   and it s kinda     wow   they really translate dnd to the game really good and it s awesome    it will be overwhelming at first   I get it   but after sometimes you play   you will know what to do   or not   just enjoy it with your own pace   seriously     you know that there be a lot of class   sub class   spell   cantrip etc etc from dnd   you will love this on the game     larian studio again   borislav slavov   successfully make a game ost that will be in loop in my spotify

inventory   truly game be glorious', 'edit   well the whole thing be out now and I give it a thumb up   if you be a fan of turn base rpgs this be definitely a must have   the game do suffer from some pacing issue as the game progress   I also find the itemization to be rather hoe hum   you get a ton of magic item with just some random spell on it that you will never use or its a tailor make item for a class you be not play   useful item be few and far between which be a shame as loot be a core part of any good d d campaign   but overall its a nice entry to the genre     first off   while this be a thumb down review   that recommendation be strictly for the game in its current form and at its full price point    I love this game   very well design and the story just grab I from the get go   so why the negative review   simple   if you buy this game now you will not be happy   you will either hate the game and not be happy or you will love the game and become very frustrated that level    be the current cap and not be happy   usually one can buy a game that be in early access and either support a struggle developer finish that first big game or get a price break for buying in early or in many case both   larian be a major studio who will make this game without any help from we and they be charge full price for the unfinished product   there be simply no reason to buy this game now   wish I have wait for the full product', 'honestly   it s just really damn good', 'I have sex', 'baldur s gate    make I rediscover my deep love for game   every single decision you make actually matter and impact your playing experience   can you imagine that   the immense amount of freedom this game grant you make you think about your next playthrough even though you re not even do with your current file   you can replay this game so many time   without ever experience it the exact same way   I just love it with my whole heart       the story s so insanely good and all the companion be so well write that you actually start to care about they after a while', 'I ve be game for over     year   ever since the ne and super mario bros   bring a new era of gaming to the state   I didn t know until later that the ne have help to revive the gaming industry after a crash    my favorite way to play video game become computer gaming in the late      s   with the release of game like baldur s gate   ultima online   diablo     and counter strike   these game be all so different from each other   but they all offer something special   baldur s gate have an incredible story and game change action   ultima online be a massively multiplayer sandbox that give gamer the freedom to do whatever they want   diablo    have an excellent atmosphere and fast pace arpg action   and counter strike have fast pace action and perfect shoot mechanic as an online shooter    over the year   I ve play many other great game that have push the gaming industry forward   these include system shock   deus ex   the legend of zelda   ocarina of time and breath of the wild   final fantasy viii and ix   the half life series   portal   leave    dead   elden ring   bioshock   and the last of we   all game craft perfectly and create with so much love and talent    however   I ve notice that I ve enjoy few and few new game over time   I use to think that this be just a sign of get old   but I realize that the problem be with the gaming industry itself   most aaa title now offer the same tired system and graphic   the focus on realism have make game feel systematic    slightly lifeless as well as almost all game have some type of monetization system that just automatically make the experience feel cheap and unmotivate   what happen to use your ability and time to get the item that you want    by        I be basically only play old game   they still offer a unique experience that I couldn t find in modern game   they didn t have monetize system or focus on the realism that become so lifeless and cold   they be just well craft game that be make with a lot of labor and love by developer that want to make a great title just because they love this industry just as much as I do    then I play baldur s gate     it be everything I have be look for in a modern game   it be polished   true to the original baldur s gate   and free of monetization   it be a return to the old day when game be craft to be amazing and have an experience that once you purchase the title   once be all available for you to explore just depend how you want to play the game   there be over hundred of hour of cutscene and it would most likely take thousand of hour and multiple play through to find everything this game have to offer   each and every character feel like a completely unique being in the game   with their own voice act line that they say   create this world that feel so alive   basically your play through will be unique to you and your character   the combat while turn base still feel fast and exciting and open up s possibility for you to brainstorm new way to eliminate your foe   your environment play a big part on how you solve a battle   hope you re not stand in water while fight a mage with a lightning spell   and unlike a lot of modern rpg s   your action absolutely have an effect on this world and the people that live in it   even wear specific item can affect those around you base on their belief or their relationship to you   and it s all do so well that it feel like a living and breathe world    baldur s gate    do something different in the face of an industry that at time feel stagnant and same y   larian make a courageous game for gamer   as gamer   baldur s gate    be truly the pinnacle of gaming and I only hope aaa studio s find this as a reminder of what game can truly be    as of        I realize that I wasn t grow out of touch with the gaming industry   the gaming industry be grow out of touch with itself   baldur s gate    be a beacon of light in a foggy and ambiguous time in game   the quality and care put into bg   be what I think most game would have strive to be in the year         if you re feel like I do and you re tired of the gaming industry s monetization pitfall and careless development   I highly recommend pick up baldur s gate     it s the type of game that make I fall in love with this industry all those year ago      edit    I should clear up that the playtime here on steam do not reflect my overall playtime in bg    have an early access version on  ', 'finally finish my first run through with        hour   a solid chunk of that time be dedicate to smooch astarion   of course', 'what an awesome game   this be what a game look like when the creator actually give a crap about their fan', 'steam ask I if I want to write a review for this game     how dare I write a review for this game   let this game write a review for I so I can find out if I m worth play', 'game of the year', 'can t wait for act    and more update   update   just finish the game   I save baldur s gate and its people   I love every minute of the game       ', 'under normal circumstance   I like to finish a game before I review it   however   these be not normal circumstance   rather   these be as abnormal as circumstance get    okay   I might be exaggerate   but still    even though I m only part way through the third act of the game   I want to get this review do because   a   I want to get this write before the year s end and or this award season    b   I ll get a badge for post it during the steam award   and   c   it s baldur s          gate     you probably already know everything I m go to say   so why wait    so   yeah   what we have here be a game that be likely to win multiple   game of the year   award   will be remember in       as one of the good game of the decade   and will be find on many people   list of the great game of all time   it be an absolute triumph in nearly every possible way   and we should all be grateful that it exist   that may sound hyperbolic   but I mean every word   this game could shake up the gaming landscape as we know it in way that only benefit we as player   in a world of battle pass   loot box   and dlc   here come with its       swinge   a    complete game whose developer have no plan for dlc   whatsoever   even eactivisionsoft will sit up and take notice when this game continue to exist in the public consciousness for a long time to come        I hear you shriek into your monitor or phone or pda or whatever       let I answer your question with another question   what other game would have the player walk in on a goblin porke an orc in a barn and then have to kill they to keep they from rip your team apart in a blue ball rage   how about have the player talk a mad scientist into perform surgery on himself to avoid fight he in a boss battle   how about let a helpful but overly zealous bard pull out your character s eyeball in an attempt to remove the yeerk from their head   only to replace it with an eyeball he have in his pocket   sound like fun   no    no   oh   maybe I could have phrase it well   yes   this game be fun as hell    you ll find all of that in this game   or you win t   maybe you ll find all different stuff   the number of different path and event in this game be genuinely staggering   normally this be the kind of thing that would give I choice paralysis   force I to turn the game off and never come back again     since every choice lead to something interesting   surprising   or   yes   fun   I never really feel like I be miss out   honestly   I just feel like I need to play it again some time and choose completely different option next time    okay   let s run down the list of other great stuff in this game   this game be gorgeous   even on my ancient gtx        the character be believably expressive   add to the immersion   the music be memorable   the voice act be excellent   and narratively   this game be immediately grip and never let go   basically   anyone who have a litmus test for what make a good game   this game pass   it s almost guarantee    the story would be nothing   of course   if it wasn t full of amazingly badass character   every member of the player s party come with an interesting back story and a set of side quest that will determine their fate as the story unfold   seriously   even the sucki character   wyll   have a cool story   and   as you re probably aware   you can romance any of the people on your team and you ll learn even more about they   I haven t even mention the horde of npc that the player encounter throughout the realm that have full story of their own    now   this wouldn t be one of my review without share one of my objectively awful opinion that s likely to leave you completely dumbfound about how I manage to even play game at all    other than say that wyll suck   that be    so   here it be   I wish there be a setting to bypass all of the dice roll during conversation   not just the animation    the whole ass mechanic itself   as someone who doesn t give two fart about d d   the dice roll just feel like a way for the game to keep my character from do what I want they to do   I ve be play this for well over      hour   and I ve only just start act iii   so I m count on another few dozen hour   at least   and I m get old enough that I ve begin stare into the face of my own mortality   so I just want the decision I make in the game to be follow through with    not check against rng to see if my decision would work out   in a world where nabbit and funky kong exist   I don t think it s too much to ask     as it be   I ve spend a great deal of time sit in front of the loading screen after reload my last save because a die roll didn t go the way I want it to    I ll give you a moment to get your heartrate back to normal   take ten deep breath   do you still feel like smash your keyboard or phone or stylus or whatever   okay   take another second    do you get it out of your system   okay   let s get back to it    I know that I be talk up the different   random path the player can find themselves take through the story just a little bit ago   but I think the die roll would be well on my second playthrough   I d love to see what kind of crazy crap happen when I fail a die roll for tell a bog hag to eat        but   on my first time through   I don t want the outcome to be out of my hand   I just want to tell she to eat crap and let nature take its course without rng get in the way    okay   I m do disparage the fundamental mechanic of ttrpgs   however   I d be an even crappier reviewer if I didn t remind reader that this game be with hundred of different possible outcome in any give moment of the game    so there be bug   I ve have the game crash several time   which be frustrating until I remember to save early and save often    which bring I to one of my favorite feature of this game that I haven t hear much about   when I first start play   I try rely on the autosave to carry I through the game   this be a mistake    it only reliably autosave when you enter a new map and the map in this game be   care to take a guess      instead   the game allow the player to make manual save    have you be battle for way long than you expect and now your mom be call you downstairs for dinner   you can save if you need to   be you in the middle of a conversation with an npc but your cat have become a puke cyclone   so now you ve get to step away and get mop   save   be you in the middle of a date with your in game romantic interest where you can see their nip and you want to come back to it again later    for science   save   save   save    I know it s a silly thing to love about a game that be revolutionary in many way but I m a simple man   I d love to see this feature show up in more game in the future   autosave have come a long   long way but sometimes I d love to be able to make manual save whenever I want   too   I want it all    anyway   that s enough ramble   I think   this game be fantastic   it s my game of the year for good reason    it even beat out    an outstanding remake of my favorite game of all time    bar financial or health reason   everyone should play it   that mean    should play this game   if you re somehow still on the fence about play it despite there be over          positive review of the game at the time of writing and   for some reason   this review be the one that be go to tip the scale   it s worth every penny you ll spend on it and many   many more', 'only the first act of this game be interesting   beyond that   I personally lose interest quite quickly   also   I don t enjoy my companion lust at I every second when I simply try to be their friend   you can imagine my shock when experience the weave with gale go from a platonic experience to one involve lust especially after he just finish explain how much he love mystra    I try to enjoy this game   but I find none play it', 'why be everyone in my party so hot', 'I be look for a   d d style game that didn t require other real people   I m really shy and just learn all this stuff   and find this game   it be far above and beyond what I be look for and be so happy', 'this be the good game I ve ever play', 'as an average player   I do not recommend bg   in its early access    I m recommend this because I want to support its further development   but this be one of those early access game that be truly still in development when they say it be   I love that they re take this game seriously   I can t wait to play the finished product   and I want to support they to hopefully create the good d d video game ever   but I don t have the time or the desire to replay the same content multiple time due to character progress wipe   so for now I ll sit and wait patiently for the      release    I know it seem like I m state the obvious   but many time when big game be deign to be put out for early access   the game be largely finish   and it s rare for the developer to make core change that drastically affect the final product   it s mostly to generate hype   get free promotion from streamer   and collect lucrative marketing datum from its player   while occasionally turn out token bug and balance hotfixe   but in this case   they really do mean it be      fedora tip to those few out there who be commit enough to hold on for the bumpy ride through character wipe   save file invalidation   story change   and spoil your experience of the final product   carry on you noble sausage  ', 'this be a game that gamer want   no monetization bs   full experience for    price and a high level of collaboration between devs and player   this be the new standard that all other devs publisher should meet', 'I have not play any baldur s gate game before   nothing from the dev before ever     I play d d     yrs ago   a lot   this game let s I do just that again   I wouldn t know if it s canonical      I can t remember wtf thac   really be     but this game   do what I need it to    play d d with friend   it s definitely   early access   at the time of my writing this   so be warn   it s rough around the edge   but once it get finish   and my band of crony start all over again   for the last time hopefully    it s go to be a d d party of epic proportion   ya don t know what ya don t know   ', 'I m invest        into a well gaming setup just so I can romance the twink vampire in   khd   this game be what happen when you pay your voice actor properly   and coincidentally one of they be actually neil newbon', 'wow   a few step back   from the norm as well as the original baldur s gate game   but a huuuuuuge improvement in every other respect    this game be basically dnd      original sin   which I mean in the good possible way    and if you ve play the original sin   you will find a lot of familiar thing   the game look absolutely stunning   the writing be simply magnificent   and the world be humongous and relatively well fill out   I ve play for      hour and be still in act I   take my sweet time to explore every nook and cranny   so much to do    eagerly await an expansion that bring the level cap to      edit   which be very unlikely to happen  ', 'in all fairness   I have write a review with mostly positive remark when this game be first launch and I have only recently begin to adjust to the last chapter   but the letdown that act    leave I with make I ponder a little more on how much baldur s gate    s lofty promise be actually unfulfilled   and how   strip of all bias and status quo notion   it s a game that s not quite as fulfil as it purport to be   I hate to be unfair and categorise this game as not recommend so I ll go the opposite route   however   I must say this review be heavily opinionate and I find baldur s gate    more underwhelming than I find it groundbreake    start off   I d like to clarify myself by say that I have no complaint regard the game s performance as an intermediate roleplaying game   I be by no mean imply that it be a low quality production or completely unsuccessful endeavor   however   like with any game   it have its shortcoming as well as its asset and they need to be address   in the current   almost industrialize market   it be definitely not impossible to find properly do roleplaying game with a mature and strike depth   but it can be difficult   therefore   while I can understand to some extent to hope baldur s gate    to be some sort of a saviour to a genre that have be suffer a long term decline   it be in no way the absolute roleplay or d d experience   nor be its performance equivalent to the hype it s get    I don t think a proper and healthy baldur s gate    review can be do without touch on the prequel   and although they span quite different time period and persona   this game be heavily fuel by the classic and naturally   forget realm lore   if you re relatively unfamiliar with the saga   it s worth catch up on a selection of the plot point and figure that preoccupy the original   time of trouble aka the fall of the god be one of the most widely know and debate chronicle in the realm history   central to all this turmoil be the theft of the tablet of fate   by two member of the dead three   myrkull and bane   cause the entire pantheon and the weave to collapse   the classic narrate the tale of one of bhaal s child   abdel adrian in canon   I personally assume largely because the story analysis of the campaign have already be do in both the video game and the novel   with bhaal be merely a fragment of a deity as of now   that larian would not be rehash the same controversy   but that be not the case   it s a game that refuse to venture out of its comfort zone   another major event discuss in baldur s gate    be descent into avernus   yet another baldur s gate campaign publish for   e   player descend into the first layer of baator and face archdevil zariel   which end with tiefling and elturel save in canon   baldur s gate    take place merely a few month after this incident    while none of these event be the direct narrative of the game itself   once you subtract they from the equation   one be leave with nothing more than a rather stale but typical mindflayer kidnapping   hence one of my big complaint about this game   it fail to capitalise on the rich nature of the universe it be set in   it feel like a patchwork of a few familiar figure and theme from the classic and canonical event of the time period it reference   and as such   I feel it s a game that lack personality or authenticity   that put all its burden on overdone fan service   it oscillate between cater to fan of the original game   myself include   endear itself to the mainstream community with status quo storytelling   and serve incel in search of their fantasy pornography   have larian put all that effort into create an engaging   genuine and immersive plot rather than this quest for conformity   we might have have a much more admirable game on our hand    a further copilot mechanism that have also fall victim to this easily digestible search for likeability be the companion   the party banter be quite loose   as all the character lack depth and sincerity   the most superficial characteristic of their race   religion or class be exaggerated and embellish   and it be hope that a decent travel companion will come out of this once a few typical sob story that do not differ much from one another be explore in a somewhat wide range   a wizard infatuate with mystra   it s already be do countless of time   a sardonic elf who doesn t know when or how to tune down the sex talk   anyone I d find walk down the street   the githyanki who win t shut up with guttural swearing   come on   now   a similar inadequacy could be spot in the villain just as well   it speak volume about larian s character writing in this game that companion such as jaheira and minsc   who have already establish lore   be some of the only heartfelt and flesh out persona in the game    from a roleplaying point of view   I don t think the game be particularly innovative or revolutionary   be it bad   not at all   it s true that you can influence the story in many context   and some of the interaction be quite fluid   but it isn t any more groundbreaking than solve a puzzle in an escape room   it do the most necessary thing that a roleplay game have to do in order to be consider a roleplay game   rather than an immersion that dominate the whole game   we see a more modest attempt of this   in my opinion   act    be much more successful in those term    the impression of freedom the game convey be a bit deceptive as well   and I attribute this to the fact that our fantasy roleplay game vocabulary have long since shrunk   but whether what make a role playing game liberating be the ability to climb every wall and stand on every stone   or the limitlessness of what the world have to offer   be where we can differ   baldur s gate    offer a space you can navigate with ease   absolutely   with a few scroll in your pocket   there be no destination one can not reach   no door one can not open   but the problem be that there be not much behind that door that be worth pull the staff up and cast the spell   the player can do many thing   true   but the game do not take sufficient responsibility to thrill the player    also   weak imitation of a dungeon   dungeon be my favourite part of d d and I m truly disappointed in that regard   they lack the level richness and storytelling of durlag tower   watchtower   arcanum dungeon and even cae nua   and they lack the ambiance that make d d what it be', 'I love karlach', 'act      great   almost         act      also great   but weak compare to act           some crack start to show   act      game start to fall apart    performance issue   many bug   most of the dialogue be one liner   abysmal companion reactivity and great deal of cut content   a shame that bring down previous act   end    almost mass effect    level of failure   no slideshow or well epilogue   just the cutscene   few word and that s it   most of the ending be result of few last choice in the game   it really suck the joy of first act that you do not get to see or hear of any consequence of your action    despite the game be really good   the act    and end dissapointe I so much that I can not recommend it   I hope it will be fix in some kind definitive edition as larian do in the past    I hope to edit this review then    edit as of patch      with most bug take care of   some new content and epilogue   finally   I be change review to recommend   act    still have its problem   but now it do not weight down on the game as much as before', 'a game have not make I feel this way since rdr', 'dnd experience on

enjoy this adventure and have a good ol   time   so you would be correct in think that s exactly the case   the first day of ea be fantastic   the bug be minimum if any and the performance be decent on a mid spec pc   I be surprise the game run so well   and with so much of the development ahead of they at this point    the good part though be the game play and how you interact with the world   the choice indeed matter here and how you play in this sandbox be totally up to you   but it s not all rose and rainbow   what hold this game back be something as important as game play   this be the cast   while their model be fantastic and voice perfectly   the emotion just weren t there yet   a find family make up of rag tag team of misfit would usually be the perfect recipe for fun dialogue   emotional depth and inspire scenario but here I feel that be lack   but it s only early access and that could be improve upon   get to know these character well and explore the story arc   which I have high hope for and be eagerly await    but go back to what work   the character creation be fantastic and allow you to play with surprisingly high amount of freedom   the perfect example be my first play through wizard aptly name    the wizard of the coast ally rock     I like be a jack of all trade and want to explore the map to gain a sense of the world which be unfamiliar to I be only a new fan of table top game such as d d   coc   the one with tentacle    and a wizard be able to learn any spell seem pretty fun      hour in     my wizard be a capable of such feat as   jump really high   why     teleportation   nice     talk to animal   okay yeah that s cool I suppose    talk to the dead   wait what    invisibility   change shape name a few   which also mean that I could basically travel anywhere   get past any trouble   pretend to be my enemy and have fun with the fact that I m my enemy   jinx    so I leave my team behind   across the map   find fish people   find people who eat those people   find a witch do witch stuff   good or bad   never get down to find out which be witch   but always keep the memory of the one I leave behind     just about a half a mile away   good fun   good time    so where do this all lead to then   here   now   soon   today I think   could be as far as tomorrow                                                            cont

character and the lack of unimportant but world building event   thankfully I be so pleasantly surprised to learn most of the character have have a major writing transformation   some of my least like character such as shadowheart and gale be some of my favourite now   githyanki be still hard to love    I suppose that s lore accurate     but truly the character writing and dialogue as well as their input along our adventure be well craft and completely natural   love every second that I spend with my companion      additionally   the combat be satisfy as usual   I m play hard difficulty and with the karmic dice off which mean that every battle feel a little more compelling and satisfying to complete   truly there be nothing else to announce about the combat   it s just great   the world feel a little more familiar as we travel and the new character get all the more strange which be a good thing   sometimes    it s also big   I ve spend the same time I spend in ea in    year to complete this first act alone lmao   be act    just as big   I m not too sure and also will it be as well craft as act    which supposedly have    year of ea to twist every loose bolt   it s time to find out                                                          cont    act      complete         hrs at review time      patch        if act    be perfect then you can be safe in know that act    be well than that   but seriously   act    be a       for I   which be still amazing   where it lack be the combat scenario compare to act    some thing you would only know with the context of continue the journey   that be to say that act    feel like its purposefully hold back   in a level design degree   to not overwhelm the player   in do so it lack the amazing set piece soon to come    and it should be clear that if this game end here   as in act    I would be completely satisfied   feeling as though this be only the first instalment of a trilogy   but it be not so   the story continue and so do the game                                                        cont    act      complete         hrs at review time      patch          hotfix       under construction   ', 'durge roleplay for the win

game   well you can pet the dog    the owlbear at same time   d    I love the final battle they bring a   real treasure be the friend along the way   you pretty much can change how you do it base in every choice you make in the game     the game get constant patch and fix which in my opinion increase content in a really good light   the new animation for your romantic pair make I reload some save to enjoy the wholesome update   and in my new adventure I love the sweet trait     I defend the epilogue with every fiber of my bone     lastly and not least important   I enjoy multiclass everyone with a bard lvl and play around act     that s something I highly recommend everyone to do   besides the achievement of      coin   it a legit great hide mechanic in the game   d       personally I find the use of tadpole somewhat cut content   you get that ugly af look   but that s about it   nobody comment on your veiny face and there be not a downside   besides look ugly af     while I play the coop   I will not recommend for it    cause while it be my own problem   I try with    different group but everytime the campaign fall throught due to someone do other stuff and with time forget about the save      and its somewhat a big game   so personally I have a well experience play alone than coop     you might not want to leave your house   go to work   go to gym   forget to eat    cause the story and gameplay be addict   I will not recommend for you to do that     you re go raise your standard for a lot of thing after play this   to a point where you will not feel comfortable pay      in a game which offer less than an indie game sell by        at your own risk   if you go for       achievement   you re go to have nightmare with tentacle    so keep that in mind     to start it off   you have two main path as durge   be an evil durge   which let your dark desire consume you   enjoy it more   or fight back against your inner evil to achieve   your sin be your own now   without the influence of your father     my choice   as evil durge be funny   actually wasn t so lonely   but I do a lot of gashlight in the campaign   hack off gale s hand   karlach s head   open the door to tiefle camp and say to zevlor   it s just a prank bruh xd    which actually pay off   romance minthara in an evil run be def worth after they fix she and the new romance patch   the way you both end as a couple with   redflag   whatever make he she even hot   for each other and I find that on point fun fact she be the only companion not mind control when you control the brain at the end     get the slayer form brutalize isobel be unique to say the least   the duel with orin and the new orin interaction while explore act     be in my opinion one of the good trait to see the game in the eye of durge instead of tav   the gameplay itself of durge be very interesting too   the cape which make you invisible after every kill be one of good item ever   rip alfira but this be legit one of good item in the game    somewhat due to the fact durge be the guy who steal the crown of karsus from mephistole   I think we lack some funny pun with raphael while storm his house besides   harleep say you re bad in bed xd     legit love the theme song for raphael     I find interesting I do mostly for the roleplay purpose   but you can arabela yeet herself of life which be a kid   but when you get to act     you can kill two child control an automaton   and the cherry on top be the ginger girl you find stray from her mother which like you   orin sacrifice she in front of you if durge disregard the kid importance astarion and minthara approval seal    after defeat orin you can use speak with the dead in the girl and get some extra grim dialogue   in this game you can be so evil   as in fact kill child without mod   I be legit amazed by this and do mostly for the roleplay of evil lord and stuff   but the fact it s in the game crackle I up a bit ngl    lastly I find interesting   durge s hair   change with blood   only char in the game with this unique trait   very nice cosmetic trait', '   when I first see gameplay of baldur s gate     I really do not think that

character creator be mostly well than before release   no more mandatory lanky barbarian or fighter   the face choice be expand a bit but there s just not enough variety for I   hope to see either larian or modder add to they   I also wish the hireling system let you create your own party rather than just have a bunch of prebuilt choice to pick from    story time   kid   I actually think the

the story be the ending    the ending   ah yes   the do option a or do option b   big let down for I   the character do have some   conclusion   to their personal story line   though that amount to some dialogue right after the final choice and that s it   not even a little paragraph tell you what become of they   great   apparently people snoop around in the file find that there be plan

start from the divinity original sin    one   there be of course go to be a lot of similarity that didn t mesh   and lo and behold   larian do and still do listen to their fanbase   people be rightly say that jumping be obnoxious   it get fix   people be rightly have problem with diceroll   they get fix   people be rightly say that backstab shouldn t give advantage   and it get fix   I have never see this level of prompt response and engagement with the community    and that s not touch how high the production value be even now   it s without a doubt the most gorgeous game in my library   it sound fantastic both in music and voice act   and the whole experience be just fantastically immersive   not to mention the character      the game be in early access right now   so yeah it need to be fix   yeah some part need to be expand or redone and yeah   it hurt that we can t get past act one yet   but holy guacamole be a good start and well follow up    I recommend it with all my heart   ', 'game completion update   the ending be underwhelming to I   feel very rush   the quality of the game decrease significantly in act    with bug   convoluted quest and poorly design encounter that take forever because of throw a dozen or more enemy at you   I really enjoy the first two act but act    drain I to the point of fatigue   overall   this be a fantastic game but quality of life issue and turn base combat be lack   I fully expect that when larian release the definitive edition   this game will be a far well experience   that be say    I don t think this game be a         but compare to the other trash that be out there   this game deserve a       full release update   it be a good game but be still more d os than bg   I m happy to say that larian address my concern with d d   e   they have do what they can within reason to improve it for gameplay    e be still bad in my opinion    character creation be a bit of a disaster currently in my opinion   there need to be a third   middle ground body type   your current option be either meth head skinny with a barely acceptable face or a steroid simpleton with weirdly proportion face   next   the face be terrible for both gender   there need to be much more customization   mod be now the only hope for future improvement in my opinion   class selection do an awful job inform player of the future subclass choice      if you re buy this because you love the divinity series   you will not have basically any issue   the problem that the game have arise quickly when you be buy this as an old school crpg gamer    let I say what s good before I hurt everyone s feeling   this game be definitely a fairly hefty improvement to cinematic direction in rpgs   conversation be very good both graphically and content wise   the facial capture be refresh and add a lot of depth overall   that in my opinion be what shine beyond the divinity framework    keep in my the following remark be likely early access remnant   this game be not baldur s gate     it may be set in the same universe but apart from that it be     percent divinity   play through the beginning feel exactly how divinity do   from the same slow combat   to the same floor loot   to similar appearing ui   to literally copy the opening of do     start on a boat ship and land on a beach   the same camera system   if I be to sum this up constructively I would say   this game really need to differentiate itself from do    it doesn t feel like this game have develop its own unique persona yet   I say yet because I really hope on full release it can feel like something different than do    and give larian the benefit of the doubt due to future art pass and game improvement    I will end this review by agree that I buy this full well know I would encounter what I mention   I have play do   and enjoy it   but also be very irritated by its system and its slow improvement over the year   I would rather be annoy and support the ip for this genre to remain viable in creation    I understand not everything will be address but hopefully in time I will recommend this    update as of may     and full clear   I still can t recommend this game for a few reason       I have come to conclude that d d   e be just not capable of produce a rival for the creative and combat freedom that divinity have   I say that because honestly the gameplay devolve into a monotonous experience past the first few hour   nothing really change   spellcaste feel very weak and far too long rest reliant   whereas fighter and thief feel far more consistent and powerful but monotone   don t misunderstand I   spellcaster have a purpose   but they often be worthwhile      of the time follow by      of be the world s punch bag   without any generation of threat but by simply exist   I think this game can be far well than it be if larian could purge a fraction of the   e purity and make entertaining design choice that fall outside of   e       itemization be laughable currently   there aren t many meaningful item drop that will really impact gameplay and save up gold be pointless as there really isn t anything worth buy   I m certain you could finish a run without equip any different gear than the starting equipment       I don t think much of the party character have content of substance   sure   they have background lore and va but not much reactionary input or character development   if I think these character be garbage to begin with   find a way to make I understand they and see past the unlikable personality and develop at the minimum   camaraderie and at good   to create emotional connection that make a game memorable and enjoyable       craft system at all   just wonder', 'I never feel this respected and value as a player

superb and the voice over work that be present at this point be extremely well do and very convincing   the environment be detailed and immersive with excellent background noise    how s it play   oh   this have I conflict as I really enjoy my real time combat with tactical pausing   I enjoy a good turn base game like x com    or wasteland       but I be hope for a more pillar style for my sequel of the century   anyways combat be fast and fluid except when it break and every enemy in the map get it s turn and it take          forever to resolve   that s a bug   I know    how s the story   it s cool   I don t see how it even remotely relate to the previous title   other than it be set in baldur s gate in the forget realm world   but then bg    be set in amn so whatever   the character be

 well this game have alot of face   on one side it s a larian game and many people wanna compare it to divinity original sin    in hope it will become some kind of   spiritual succesor   to it   on a different face this have baldur gate    in the title   so people look back to the old bg game and try to compare it to that   but the truth be   bg   be none of those    bg   it s a separate beast   mainly because its base on the d d   th edition ruleset   so if you ve play d d   e   you ll recognize alot of thing from it in here   this be why some people be inclined to dislike bg   at first    people who come from do and don t know d d   e find it too alien and ask for change in hope for the devs to steer the game back into that direction   they tend to dislike the game because it s so unfamiliar to they   narratively and mechanically    on the other hand bg   and    people seem to forget that those game be base on the advance dungeon and dragon    e   ruleset   which be vastly different   and the bhaalspawn story be conclude by the second installment   so again they tend to dislike the game because it s so unfamiliar to they   narratively and mechanically    I find bg   to be    it have alot of the core feature in it   and from what I hear larian plan to have all or at least as close to all of they as possible at launch   which be awesome   from the player perspective   it s so refreshing to just be able to boot up a game and play a d d   e campaign without have to schedule meeting with other and run a    hour session   don t get I wrong I still do that   but it s so cool to have that experience without all the effort that you have to go through in real life lol      bg   be also    the rpg element be so well define   combat be fluid and take pace just as if you be use roll    or pen and paper   well it s quite fast since you don t have multiple people think over what to do    animation and graphic be wonderful to look at   and the narrative it s deliver in such a cinematic way   also something to note   combat can be very difficult   because most of the enemy you see even if they be take from the d d lore be alot more powerful than in d d   like   you see goblin cast bless and use action surge n stuff   which make I laugh   goblin be scary here    even in early accsess   bg   can give you     to     hour of gameplay per character you make   that s if you d like to try more than one class   and you probably will   and though content will be the same   there be multiple way of deal with the same situation you face   wich be something not many game offer    the game do have it s bug here and there   but nothing gamebreake   and the game still have plenty of room to improve   we ll see where larian take this game to   but it s look good so far', 'I haven t finish it yet   and I don t expect to finish it any time soon   act    take I about     hour   act    be suppose to be        hour long   and I haven t even get to act    yet    it s

conversation    it s base on the d d    ruleset   but they make some necessary change   like no prestidigitation spell     one thing to be aware of    long rest   a bunch of cutscene that advance the story will happen in the camp   when you rest   for this reason   I suggest rest quite often   you can also go to the camp and   end the day   without take a long rest to get the story stuff', 'hard to even know what facet of the game to address first   so many compete question and concern from fan of baldur s gate   the divinity series   and classic crpgs generally    let I say first that I have      hour in the game as I write this   and I have not finish the content   the content in the   first act of the game contain in the pre release    needless to say   anyone concern about the scope of the game be insufficiently epic be go to be pleased   speaking of common concern   anyone worry about a lack of continuity to the previous game in the series will also be pleased   assume they keep an open mind   many of the notable difference from the early game be down to there having be three     edition of dungeon    dragon release since baldur s gate     and the ensue change in game design that have arise since   even an isometric game   if use   rd edition rule   would have quite a different feel   as see in icewind dale ii    to say nothing of how much more controversial a   th edition take would have be   it genuinely annoy I how tiefling be everywhere when there be   what   literally one in the entirety of the first two game   but again   this be       from the parameter set by   th edition   and larian be just do right by the source material here    but yes   beyond that   obviously larian be produce a game use a mixture of their own style of crpg and the pre exist influence   I definitely never think I would shoot a fire arrow to blow up an oil field in baldur s gate   but the thing be   any critic be intellectually honest should acknowledge that this kind of turn base game with the possibility of more open end and innovative combat tactic be what many people think baldur s gate should have be in the first place   consider yourself lucky if you do not remember the   this isn t d d   argument when it come out that the game would be playable in real time   or the complaint that there be no creativity to combat tactic   remember how a single wolf could wipe out half your party in the first chapter     this be to not even mention the   black isle make a cash grab   complaint when baldur s gate s sequel be still call   baldur s gate    despite the city not make even a single appearance in the game   some people can not help but hate anything new   and those people in time will either realize the new thing be actually good     or will still be complain about   say   fallout    a decade later    speak of fallout     one of the thing I find most interesting about larian s effort here be that they have bring in a more complex conversation system than ever exist in most infinity engine game   planescape   torment perhaps notwithstanding    but despite it be a change   I imagine even people otherwise critical of the game s direction be happy to see skill and ability score   and race   and class   and background   and and and   serve a purpose in conversation   for that matter   it be hard to imagine many complaint about baldur s gate iii be an incredibly gorgeous game overall   or have an astoundingly compelling and grandiose opening cinematic that set the tone   some truly outlandish and mind boggle event be take place   and you be at the very center of they all    but yes   if you read the discussion forum   which I do not recommend do until the troll have         a little more bored    you might get the impression that this game have nothing to do with baldur s gate i and ii   well   I mean   it have more to do with those two game than fallout    do with the first two fallout   or than neverwinter night    have to do with     or than icewind dale ii have to do with I   or might    magic vi do with v   or wizardry iv do with iii   look   I too would have be totally into another real time with pause isometric game   but as someone who have be play dungeon    dragon since the      s and love little more than a quality party base rpg   there be so much to love here that I have no idea how cynical you have to be to ignore they in favor of the handful of thing that do not exactly match up with what you want   no amount of tie in to the rest of the series will be enough for the naysayer   whereas when within the first hour of exploration I find a plot critical book where the story arc of a baldur s gate I companion set event in motion in this game   well   that tell I they be definitely not go to forget their history    this game be absolutely go to be one for the age   and I be already go to go ahead and say baldur s gate iv   or whatever they do as a follow up   because they obviously have one plan give the low level cap here    be already on my must buy list   give how much care have go into this game already', 'halt   fellow traveler   baldur s gate be open again    note   I buy bg   with my own money   didn t receive it via my curator group    let I make two thing clear from the very beginning   one   I see nothing wrong in mix baldur s lore and set with divinity s mechanic and visual   kill I for this   but I see it as a win win situation in general   if there be two successful concept that actually work   why not bring to the table the good from two world   if you do not agree with my point of view   you will most probably find this review disappoint   two   I believe that either mindlessly hate or feverishly praise the game in its current state be strange and   to be honest   ridiculous   and write a review after play an rpg like this for     minute be outright stupid   but it seem that nowadays it be more important to pump out a half baked review with a one line repetitive joke or an obvious troll bait just to be the   first   than actually provide useful information   oh well    now   rant aside   here be my thought about baldur s gate     they can be subjective at time   I be not go to lie   but I will still do my good to look at the situation from all side       I absolutely adore both baldur s gate title   these be two of my most favorite old school isometric rpgs that I have spend hour and hour with   the depth of this series be just spectacular    one of the most important question now be whether new baldur   bg    be just a clone of divinity   original sin     do    and its sister   one the one hand   yes   this be true to some extent as there be a lot of similarity    the ui design   inventory   character creation   some location    battle mechanic   etc    on the other hand   what really matter here be how this concept be implement   and I be happy to say that no   this be not the same case as what electronic art be do these day with its overprice shovelware product    I be honestly baffle how they release literally the same game every year and still manage to make they bad buggy than before   this be a next level talent   I swear    so   my verdict   it do not look and play like previous game   at all   I dare say   but if you want baldur s lore   set and general atmosphere   and you also enjoy how dos   work   then this be the right game   I would say that this new baldur be a love child of these two gem   it be up to you as a player to decide whether it be for the well or bad     it be pretty obvious even now that bg   be in a really early stage of its development   a lot of content have not be implement yet    for example   there will be character with preset story   the same as in do    it be a fun feature to experience   so I be look forward to try it in the future   the story be also incomplete as of now   of course   and many location be not available   I also have not see any kit as multiclassing have not be implement yet   but I do hope that larian will keep to the tradition    I be go to be really disappointed if I can not play as kensai   also   some classical class be not available at all right now   no paladin   monk or bard   for example     it be turn base   as many old classic rpgs   and there be nothing bad about it    what about the story and character I mention before   again   none of these be complete yet   but judge by what I have see so far   there be a really good base even now   I have next to no doubt that bg   will be able to present an intriguing plot with lot of twist and difficult choice   as well as a great variety of personality    speak of the visual   they be an eye candy    in term of cutscene for sure   a significant improvement compare to the original series   which be only natural consider how many year have pass since the release of bg    I would also like to praise the brilliant idea of an actual dice that be use to show your roll result   this be a small and yet very neat detail   and the last but not least   I be truly impressed with the option in character creation part   heck   this game have more skin tone than sim    but there be also some downside   first   I think developer need to tweak difficulty setting    there be currently no option available   so it be important to find a proper balance   some battle can be too challenging   even more so if you do not prepare for they or make mistake while create your character   I understand that rpgs be suppose to be somewhat unforgiving in this aspect   unless you play a story mode or something similarly easy   but still   it be no fun getting kill by a simple bottle of acid   heck my wizard s low hp     at the same time   some encounter be just too easy   I also think that battle themselves need some extra polishing   sadly   currently I can not really put my finger on what exactly I would like to change as I usually focus more on the story than fight   and I also need to get more used to the process itself   I be definitely go to update this part in the future   and the last issue    not so   occasional bug and visual glitch        some thing I personally want to see in the future              so   to finish this review   I would like to say that I be not a hardcore larian fan   but I have a lot of respect towards this company   I have play all of their game   and none of they leave I disappointed   and judge by the video   after release support and the general attitude   larian do care about both their product and fan   in my humble opinion   release baldur s gate in early access first be a good idea because it give we   player   more opportunity to influence its development and provide useful feedback   the same as it work with do     be the price justify   though   it be a very tricky question   for now   it be difficult to say something as not all content have be release yet   honestly   never before have a I spend so much money on any title   not to mention an early access one   as I do with bg    if this do not show you how much I believe in the bright future of this game   then I do not know what do   however   there be still a great deal to be do   and there be always a chance that bg   might turn out to be a major disappointment   to sum up   if you be ready to take the risk and put your trust in larian once again   then go for it and buy bg   now   if not   then well wait for the full release', 'larian studio have gold in the making here   its early access and still have some bug and performance issue to work out   but I can already see the jewel they have here   just hope the add half orc and dragonborn to the race you can be   and they add paladin   sorcer and barbarian to the

it s beyond incredible    when you think of crpgs you think of vast branch dialogue option and   choice have consequence   which be here in spade   but more so they ve expand upon the genre by add in all these extra thing you d expect of a aaa game   like the fully voice act character as well as the narration   animation have not be use to nearly this degree in any crpg that come to memory and

larian have already account for what the lawful   the chaotic   the good the bad and the ugly player have think about do in this game    I have very high hope for this game   even though I ve become relatively jade from the past few year of disappointment with other title   but time and time again I m beyond impressed and blow away by what larian have accomplish and the entire team that helped put this together should be absolutely proud    the story   character   mechanic   environment     everything about this game exceed my wild hope   I can not recommend this game enough to anyone who be look for a genuinely good experience in a video game    p s   more prop to they for not fall into modern bs with stupid pre order   micro transaction   or other crap like that   I really pray they

countless hour and recording delay I m here finally do with baldur gate    and I can share my thought about this game in all honesty    game of the decade in the making   you see game like these only few time in a decade   such level of detail   feel   complexity and replayability in bg   be very rich in abundance   you don t have to worry about season pass   micro transaction or other sketchy monetization policy   you be get a good bang for the buck truly    now I still want to be objective here with this review and offer some pro con about it    pro multilayere story that offer many different outcome that have true impact in the game and its quest line class    race offer lot of variety amazing soundtrack   lot of variety in store and create good overall atmosphere the game be long   I go near perfectionist run and it offer I     h play through', 'if you re look for pen and paper role play with animation   a fantastic story   compelling character and only the most vital aspect of the p p rpg experience   such as dice throwing and stat grow for gun ho ing with dong show   this be exactly what you always want    if you re not look for that experience   this be still exactly what you never know you want', 'I highly recommend play this game   buuut not until full release   there s a lot of content miss from the game like class   race   and even a lot of the story   this wouldn t be a big deal except for when they patch the game   you have to start all over   the content that be there be really fun   but buggy   overall I would recommend this to rpg fan   especially to play with friend   but it s not worth get in the current state   just wait till full release because this isn t the kind of game with a lot of replayability   there s only so many time you can do the beginning of the game', 'so yes it s amazing   just get it if you enjoy fantasy rpgs   but good game ever   right so I m not go to sing it s praise   as everyone else have do this job   I be go to list how it could have be well   and why it s maybe not the good game ever   because I can      level cap limitation   yes I ve read the guff online of people defend the limit of      but they could easily have allow you to level up to         without ruin the enjoyment of the game   once you be in act    and you hit      you still have load to do   although I find most fight fun at      a few more level   would have stop I have to do a bit of cheese   and this be only on balanced mode   mind    if there be certain overpowered spell   remove or nerf they   they have basically do this already anyway   dispel magic anyone      inventory and storage system   it s such a faff   yes I ve see bad   but I ve also see well   one chest for storage in your camp with limited sort option   no stacking of the same item   so many dagger slot      the aggro be too random   in the goblin camp   you get into it with one group   every goblin in the world turn on you   in a prison you break someone out   kill all the guard and you be flirt with their colleague at the top of the stair   whilst the escape prisoner be stand next to you   as the goblin camp be your first experience   it restrict experimentation   as you try and avoid combat in situation that be valid option   as you expect every man and their dog to turn on you      it s too wake   only joke   I think it be fine   you snowflake', 'honestly one of the good game I ve ever play', 'would definitely wait till the full release at this point   I like it the only problem I have with it be the inventory management   would be nice if we could multiselect item for convenience sake   other than that be fun for early access', 'overall    there be no wrong choice   any option you choose will be satisfy   npc s will react to the small thing you might not even think about   do thing in very specific way will result in awesome result that maybe only     of player will see   but larian have put it there   and put in as much effort as they would with any other option   the game reward you so much for exploration and experimentation   be horribly evil and go against what would be consider the   narrative   in a typical game can be extremely satisfying    you get unique cinematic s and information that other player win t get    your class and race make such a huge difference   you aren t just a cookie cutter character play through a predefine story    you really get to choose   it be any rpg player wet dream   I ve play through early access in full four time   and I m still discover new thing   and I ve have wildly different experience each time    replayability value alone be          this game have be create for the player   the amount of effort that they have go through to make each choice matter be insane    gameplay    it s d d   e and turn base   this might turn some people off   but I guarantee   if you have ever love a bioware game   it be so worth try out this style of game   larian rise from bioware ashe like a damn phoenix    you can throw people   you can throw object   different element interact with each other   create water   then zap it with a lightning spell to electrocute everyone   shoot the string that s hold something up   and send it crash into your enemy   you can set up some incredible fight    if you have an inner tactician   you ll love it    you may not like the dice roll mechanic which determine whether you succeed in most thing   and it can sometimes be frustrating to consistently fail at lock picking    but there be often other option   try smash the chest or door   that always work   but in all honestly   particularly with dialogue   I d say embrace the fail roll    your story will be interesting no matter what   but if you really want thing to go your way   you can always quick save before start a dialogue    story    I m review in early access     day from launch   god I m so ready   so of course I don t know the full story   but   so far   it s hook be amazing   and your character seem to be catch between a lot of grand scheme   it really do drag you in with a great mystery and serve as a great reason for you and your party member to be together despite your difference   something that any d d player know can be a challenge   you ll be tempt by power   with unknown   probably devastate   consequence   the sub plot be great too    I ve be draw into they all and have struggle to exit the game until the early hour of the morning because I just want to see how a story pan out   all of the companion character feel consistently true to themselves   and it s great   piss they off enough   and they re not just go to awkwardly stick with you   they ll leave   or try to kill you    graphic    pretty damn good for a crpg   with cinematic too   I personally find the game gorgeous   the mo cap for add personality to the npc s be great    companion    I mean   this will always be subjective   but I m sure most people will love at least one of the party character   they have such a range of personality   and alignment   that there will be something for everyone   they re one of the main selling point for I   they all seem to have awesome mystery behind they   and strong consistent personality   I feel like their story be go to be just as emotionally impact   if not more   as the main story    the romance feel organic     it s not just   get this character approval up with this cheesy way   and get reward with a sex cinematic     I mean   it s a bit of that   but it feel way more nuanced     the character apparently know who you prefer base on who you interact with first the most    and they will react to you accordingly   for example   be less open with you if you go to speak with they last   and as far as my gameplay go   that track   I ve have new camp interaction with all of the character in each of my playthrough    I love bioware     but I actually think larian might have win I in term of character writing   I ve only play through act one   and I love they already    replayability    it s just insane   play as a different race or class   and you ll already have a new experience   play evil   neutral   good or a bit of all three   and the story will change drastically   play as one of the companion   origin   character   or customise your own origin character that have a fully flesh out backstory    I m scared by the amount of playthrough I have plan   I can see myself reach       hrs    on this game    issue    sometimes dialogue trigger   and one of your companion character be use to do the talk   other companion approval reaction to this dialogue will apply to you   so gameplay wise   it function as if the player character be talk but   you lose the unique class race dialogue option   this be mildly annoying   but not game break    there be bug   but     there be bug in every game   they re usually fixable   or you can reload    final thought    damn   this be an excellent game    larian have put player feedback at the forefront of their development   this be how you do early access   of course they do it for money to help development   but they actually use the feedback to shape this game into something incredible    player love a character so much that larian make they a full companion   player didn t particularly enjoy one of the companion so larian have announce a rework to his personality story   gameplay issue that player have have mostly be resolve   and larian have try to give player as many option as possible in every aspect of the game      that whole team have work so damn hard   and they ve create a true labour of love in the process   it be spectacular     would I recommend it   yes   it be worth every penny', 'one of the good game of

way of make a roleplay game   baldur s gate iii be probably it   it tell a remarkable story   feature character of depth in a world replete with fantasy trope that avoid present as hackneye and stale despite the continue fan proliferation of the world in which it s set   the combat system be robust   choice make before and after spill blood be always compelling and occasionally move   indeed   the extent to which thing be make possible and open to experimentation be what set baldur s gate iii apart from   not nearly   but all of its contemporary    if player immersion be find in freedom   then base on its roleplay scope alone   baldur s gate iii be one of the good game ever make     baldur s gate iii use dungeon and dragon    th edition ruleset   as such   the game come stock with   mostly   set character progression for all class   it s important to note that this limitation be necessary   as baldur s gate remain a dungeon and dragon intellectual property   however   character progression still provide you agency over select the new skill you want to learn   the feat you d like to choose   and how you allocate acquire ability point for character   even then   nothing be entirely set in stone   as you can re spec or multiclass as you desire    maybe you want to be a bard   maybe a bard who s also a ranger   maybe even a bard who s also a ranger who become a barbarian   and so on   the multiclassing choice be only limit by the amount of level you can gain this number currently rest at      and there be also     character class do with that what you will      like developer larian s divinity   original sin series   baldur s gate iii use turn base combat   this be a departure from the original game   but as it be larian s expertise   it be welcome   order of combat be usually secure by a character s initiative rating   assume you start combat to begin with   stealthier folk may sneak attack a room to death without enter turn base mode    you ll choose spell via a radial menu that s replenish every time the character fully rest at camp   and you ll want to rest often because many of the story s character be develop at the campsite   battle progress like you would expect   with each class bring something useful for win some support   some attack   and some throw spell   balance your party to account for all scenario possible be recommend   especially on hard difficulty   three difficulty option    as combat can be punish   particularly in a battle s opening   you can get swarm quickly    aside from traditional turn base combat   the game within the game be really about roll dice   without tangentially explain how dungeon and dragon operate   at a base level   game progression hinge on succeed or fail dice roll   the die number read        the difficulty of the situation   self evidently determine   e g    a bank vault will naturally be hard to break into than a lockbox    set the difficulty number   the player must roll a die at or over that number to pass the check   if they roll below the number require   they fail   and it s not all bank vault   dice roll extend to nearly every playstyle lane shooting arrow   throw magic   playing music   intimidate gnome   seducing half elfs   and save companion   the rng component of this will no doubt frustrate you at time   but some of the fine moment be bear from failure    my advice   embrace that failure      the dice can be load too   depend on how you progress your character   number will automatically be add to your die base on your character   proficiency and expertise   as an example   if I need to intimidate a troll   I could get lucky and pass the roll check   or   if I have add point to my charisma rating   I ll naturally get a boost to my roll on this check   if I roll     and I need      but I receive     base on my skill   I still succeed on the roll despite roll               the above make baldur s gate iii a meta game within the actual game   there be always more go on than can be account for   and because of that   there s no way to play the same way twice without save thousand of time and reload   everything feel new and living     baldur s gate iii open by have you create a character our first introduction to larian s gift of nearly absolute autonomy   aside from customization of the standard fare   brown hair blonde   beard no beard   etc     you ll have the option of choose one of     different race own     subrace   furthermore   the player will also select one of     unique character class that combine contain an additional     subclass   all of which feel viable   you may skip customization and opt to play as any of the seven origin character that   if not select   can potentially be recruit later      I have never encounter an rpg that grace I with this many different playstyle     set      year after the event of baldur s gate ii   the game function as something akin to a soft reboot   lore   location

story open with the protagonist attempt to wrest control of a crash alien ship   your character   along with future party member   have be take captive by mind flayer a version of lovecraftian   eldritch horror   the ship rip through multiple realm before eventually crash into the land of faer n   where the player escape   all be not well   however   as the mind flayer have infect your brain with a parasite   the removal of which serve the role of the plot s macguffin   and thus   your tale begin    and   oh   what a tale it be      your introduction to faer n be swiftly place in contrast to most video game   there be very little hand holding or guidance   that s simply not larian s intent   you re give the tool to progress   to interact with the world   to try thing out   succeed   or fail   as an example   if an encountered wall be too high   stack box and climb over it   or pick the lock at the gate   or knock the gate down   or teleport over it   or simply ignore it altogether   give the sheer amount of tool at your disposal   it s hard to account for how one might deal with that wall   or that chest   or that boss   or that lover   you get what I m say here   right    in the past   rpgs   freedom in progression have typically be measure in the macro   and baldur s gate iii care a lot about that too    but it also care about how you get over that wall     baldur s gate iii

 my original criticism about write   tone and visual element still stand   with that say   this be a magnificent game and the work the studio have put into it have pay off   the amount of content   attention to detail and creativity put into this game make it possibly one of the well rpgs recent time   it be a great game   even if it be not a great sequel to the baldur s gate series of which I still feel the studio miss the mark on by do too much of their own thing   here be my full original review base on early access    not quite a sequel to baldur s gate    and not as deep as divinity original sin     this game feel like a very well make forgotten realm mod for do    while beautiful   one can t help but feel like this be a step backwards in many respect of progression for both game franchise    first   let s start with the good   this game be beautiful   even in early access   the lush landscape   vivid texture and lively design be strike and beautiful   the character concept be good   especially whomever design the little people like goblin and child which be adorable   cut scene and most dialogue be fully cinematic   give an epic feeling to much of the story progression   several of the antagonist be truly jarring and get under your skin to where you can t wait to defeat they   the camp concept reminiscent of dragon age be fun   give you a base to interact more intimately with your party member   the five of whom available now be diverse and each have their own story line which be worth unwrap   the voice act and expression of all npc be superb   give every character truly lifelike impression   you ll find yourself really like or dislike certain character immediately and want to talk to everyone to see what they have to say   the first act   which be all that be available at early access   be immensely huge   having play for     hour I be still find new area I miss on my first few playthrough   there be secret area and interesting detail to find everywhere   exploration be a major facet of this game make character skilled in athletic and perception handy   unlike do    the background of the lore have have over     year of development in the forget realm set   I never feel myself lose as I do in divinity lore but instead be intrigue   want to experience more of the history with the place involve    now for the negative   character creation be good but fairly basic by today s standard   alignment seem to have be completely omit as have deity unless you choose a cleric   in general the game can feel more like a sequel to divinity original sin    rather than bg   but oddly lack some of the small detail which make do   special   there s no craft system with use for small item   a downgrade from divinity despite the game come out    year ago   other than the general setting and the city of baldur gate itself   there isn t a whole lot that make this a direct sequel   so far we don t see a lot that would tie the game close to the theme of bg      from the starting sequence   larian pull element from forget realm have more in common with planescape or throne of bhaal   in the first zone of the game   you will meet more mindflayer   tieling and drow than you will human or elve   you can even take on several beholder and an ogre mage   some of these element feel out of place for a new character   some of the low level npc boast of be legendary adventurer although this clash with the introductory setting   like do   character level seem more arbitrary versus character background   even first level character may have complex backstorie and already be experience warrior in contrast to traditional d d where new character be consider novice   there be no explore a quaint countryside or gather your party at a tavern   from the very beginning you be cast into a fly inferno of dimension hopping spaceship   half demon refugee camp   mythal cover druid grove and even the dread underdark   the mechanic of combat be a huge downgrade from divinity which be rich and complex   here   d d   e feel rigid and simple   unlike bg   your party formation doesn t really matter   combat be slow    sometimes bore   even unintelligent npc will run or jump past your front line fighter to focus on your weak character   with no provocation system   enemy will focus fire fall party member until they have be finish off   it s almost like the ai be program not to fight like real creature would in the give situation but instead attempt to grief the player as much as possible   pushing have become one of the most powerful mechanic   often your character will get push off ledge to bottomless pit or from one of the terrain s many high cliff   this should be avoidable but due to the aforementioned ai   even seemingly disorganize goblin have the wisdom to run headfirst at your wizard to push they off a cliff at the first opportunity   for some reason you be require to manually end each character s turn in combat   even if they be unconscious and can not perform any action   this get s stale especially if your entire party be stun   often you will find your character just stand there with no good course of action in a situation   every character can jump very far which be almost comically unrealistic   tactic devolve into jump over an enemy s head to get into backstab position   improvement in navigation have be make but jump during exploration can be troublesome   despite the vast world   none of the item you find feel very rewarding and the plentiful container you can search through such as shelf and stack of book often feel rather empty or lackluster   for now   most of the gear you can find for your party be truly boring   with no craft system   mundane item become random clutter or trash well ignore   useful item like the good armor available for a fighter be the same which the single warrior companion start with at the beginning of the game   in typical larian fashion   most area of the world feel so over the top   nothing feel truly magical   it s hard to imagine find a truly special location that would stand out from the rest since everywhere be literally dripping with magic and glow light   in other word it feel more like set dressing and less like it could truly be alive   I find myself think this feel like a hyper fantastic dream world rather than a living breathing faerun    my original review criticize the game character as be unintereste   this be one of the thing that the studio put the most work in during ea development and it really show   the character have be vastly improve and the player interaction with they have be impressive   originally   larian have be focus on the more   negative   character during ea because they know that player would mostly engage with good character   they have now add more   good   companion and even rewrite some of they like wyll from the ground up   overall   the love they have pore into npc truly show', 'this be a game who do not really know what it want to be   it s ambitious   engaging   and enjoyable   it s also tear between two system   and I fear that larian will only make this bad as they go along    larian s character system be take right out of d d   e   this be actually a good thing    e have quite a lot go for it   but the big thing be the extensive play testing it have receive as a combat system    e d d have be around for awhile now   and it do an excellent job of provide robust class that work in the   e combat system   except for ranger   they botch that one    the problem here be that larian be not build their encounter system to fit d d   e   the red cap encounter be an excellent example   a monster who open an engagement on a character with a   d    attack be utterly lethal at the level you ll encounter say monster at   that damage level be usually see around level      with serious help   or with a specialized ability   add to the damage that it can knock your character prone   and you ve get a serious balance issue   in this encounter   there be three of they    this isn t the only time larian tilt the fight heavily out of your favor   in early early release   the enemy would focus fire a character into the grave once they be in the die state   with a three hit multi attack in a certain encounter   which a pc class can t pull off without dual wield and multi attack at level    or a fighter at       you basically watch a character go down   and get execute    larian also bring back the divinity cheese that be explode barrel   need to wipe out an entire legion of individual   throw a barrel at they when they re all stand together   have your friend stealthe out   and wait for it to land   the tosser may end up in combat   but you re stealthy friend be completely free to move about the world   one fire attack later   and you ve get a mob bar b que   note   some target may not die because they ve get a pile of hitpoint appropriate for their level    I don t really take issue with the early access bug   that s to be expect   they re in the game   and they can screw up your run   you know that when you buy it as an early access    I take issue with the design philosophy   this be a game trap between a strong   e rule set that be the most play test gaming system on the planet   and the utter madness of the divinity game mechanic    what make the divinity system work be the unparalleled flexibility it give it s player in building synergies   this allow the player to cope with an ever increasingly complex threat portfolio   you could die pretty often   you might have to completely strip down your character and re build they   floor up   in one session   your favorite character be a sword slicing   lightning sling   plate armor warrior   in the next   he be a no heck given   watch the world burn pyromaniacal mage    this be not how   e operate   each character have strength and weakness   and player creativity have to be employ to solve the various challenge the game bring   usually through team work   by add the kind of mechanic that belong in divinity   the game design strain the system of   e to it s very limit   larian s solution in baldur s gate be to let you face check the new bastardize concept they ve introduce   and mark your death down in their statistic   you re go to die   and it ll come down to a badly design attack that you didn t know could happen   and have no solution for prior to it s deployment   if you re fine with that   then the game might be for you    I also take issue with some of the character   gale   specifically   his back story be ridiculously stupid   consider he s a basic level one wizard   no spoiler here   but how do someone who can t even cast second level spell at your first meeting manage to pull off everything he say he do   maybe he s lie   maybe I need to murder he and leave he in a ditch   probably that one', 'I kick a goblin into the abyss while he be pee    game of the year        hour in   still create my character    I genuinely don t know how human being make this game   it s like the video game version of the pyramid   it s well than the hype   it s the good money you will spend this year    as someone who play dragon age origin so many time as a teen   play this game feel like meet a long lose friend and it make I so happy   to I baldur s gate    feel like a fully realize version of dao    after the first     hour   I be simply stunned   they manage to take everything that I ve love about d d   and distil it into a video game   to say it s be worth my time be an understatement   this be like show up to play d d and your dm have every battle map   mini   a binder of world lore ready to tie into your own backstory   voice every character perfectly   let you pickpocket the boss because it s fun   and tell you they get nowhere to be so you can play for the next four day    I literally can not get the game out of my head   the combat   the lore   the story   the sheer audacity they think they could this and they do   I love it very   very much    pretty much everything be of such an outstanding quality   the voice act   the plot   the visual   the cinematic quality   the soundtrack   ohh   the soundtrack   it s intense and beautiful   hauntingly sad   it s about deeply flawed people   about redemption and love and forgiveness   there be a vast amount of quest   often compellingly write   you get attach to character   you take your time read note because not only do they tell you more about the lore   they help you understand what be happen and make decision upon it   this game be     gb and they re all use for something that matter    I think the complexity of the game be its selling point   the world be so dense with content   fill with character who directly influence the story and be directly influence by it   even a random npc that you chat with in act    could end up play a major role in the story by act       or no role at all if they die instead   you can see the layer within the decision making   which give weight to everything you do   who you save   kill   team up with   etc   all end up tell a different story   make the game really feel like it s your story be tell   then they do that thing that separate good writer from average   make absolutely memorable character   make you invest yourself emotionally in they and then put they into impossible situation where they can t possibly win    the fact you can play       hour on your first playthrough and come back for round    to have a literal unrecognizably different story play out be part of the magic   there will be   do you know in baldur s gate     video for year to come as people find more and more   it s actually so amazing   my wife s boyfriend be do his own play through and then do one with I and he s get a completely different experience and dialogue    I have three save right now    each one feel so dramatically different from the other   from time change world event   to origin companion dialogue   to choice you make as you re play    there re so many aspect that change completely   it s so interesting and show your action really do change the story   this game reward creativity in an almost infinite number of way   the choice present to the player during the course of the story be staggering in number and a lot of they be impactful   few game will reach this level of excellence   well do larian    I also really can t get over how every little piece of extra attention you give to an item or an area be reward   you can go from stumble onto a regular book or chest in a random area to have a    hour quest you d otherwise have totally miss   there s probably      hour of content minimum that the game doesn t steer you towards at all   like there s entire area you can only find by hover your cursor over a small hitbox that some player may never discover   all my friend who play have vastly different playthrough from one another    the voice act alone make this game perfect   it just feel like you be part of a big adventure and there be so many thing to do and so many way to do it that it beg play it over and over again   even let the dice fall as they do vs save scumming be a strategy   the character take I back to care like I do back in mass effect   and it s true turn base which I have grow to love as I ve fall out of fps s and move to a primarily single player game player    the rule set   which be the hard thing to comprehend for non d d people   be pretty accessible and the tutorial work well   it do require some planning   but you can watch a video or two and get a gist   there s also no ironman mode or anything   so you can literally mess up an infinite amount of time with no repercussion   if you get it   make sure to save frequently   the game save at odd time and isn t very consistent   there s no rolling   save every     min   or anything    on top of that   the tactic of the combat be immensely satisfy   it can be obtuse at time because there be load of status effect   environment effect   spell   item   and condition that can overwhelm you if you re not pay attention   but to those who want to pay attention   there be nothing more fun than examine an enemy   determine their weakness   see they have a weak wis and use a spell with a wis save to completely neuter they   in that way   fight have a way to be incredibly difficult if you re not pay attention to the detail or an absolute breeze if you know how to use every tool at your disposal    yes   this really be a once in a decade kind of game   crazy it be also a      no string attach no shop   no pass   no dlc   just one huge and complete game   truly have permanently raise larian into rpg developer godhood among the like of those like square and bioware   I m convinced this masterpiece will be study by many game developer for year to come   it s a game that will be reference for decade   as far be the specific genre go and arguably game in general it just set a high bar   much to the displeasure of dogsh t publisher and devs everywhere    bg   be not a perfect game but man the experience   replay value   freedom be unparalel to anything I have ever see   you can just feel that every person involve with this game have put all their effort and devotion to this   it s make with so much love   it s a game that stay with you    if you like dragon age origin   I guarantee you ll like the game   it s a crpg but also a successor to bioware game like da   kotor   and mass effect   and obviously the original baldur gate game if you re old like I    I highly recommend it        ', 'it s a monumental   once in a lifetime release   I m grateful to be live in the same era as baldur s gate     what a game', 'I wouldn t recommend this game to anyone at its current stage   larian be a great studio and I do have confidence in their final release   however   currently the game be more of a d os      with bland writing and less interesting character    update   ok I do sink another      hour into the game   the character building and the combat be very loyal to dnd   e   it feel very d os    at the beginning   because the animation   combat flow   and probably some larian ish environmental effect they add to the spell but as you play through the game you d notice the difference between this and d   os be huge   if you be a fan of   e then you d love it   though the current version be still rough   however   I really don t like the current design of ability check in dialogue   sometimes you d need to pass two or three consecutive successful ability check in a row   which make the probability of success extremely low   also   when you be roll for a ability check   it didn t automatically choose your party member who have the high probability of pass a ability check   which be annoying   as for the character backstory   it s very lacking right now   but I do see some interesting tag in their character sheet   so we will see how larian tell their backstory   for itemization   I get the idea of make   green   or   blue   magical item easy to access for the appeal of average gamer   I m not strongly against it since these item I get so far be not game breaking   but I think this feature need to be tone down a bit   compare to d os   ', 'this be probably the good game I ve ever play in my life', 'I feel strong intent to relearn once I think fluent language to find many more appropriate

s gate    be an excellent game   I haven t enjoy a game this much since I be a kid play dragon age for the first time   everything be so well think out   down to the small detail   you can play alone or with friend   and you can choose to be a force for good or chaos   just be prepared to read a lot of text and enjoy the ride    here be some of the thing I love about baldur s gate      the story be engage and full of twist and turn the character be well developed and relatable the combat be challenging and reward the world be vast and full of secret to discover    if you re a fan of role

understand game   come out   as early access   but if you don t have an release date and or more then half the game do after more then a year   it doesn t look good on you   all of that while charge over      for less then a fifth of a game that could and I mean could be an awesome successor to the bg series   but as it stand right now I can t in good conscience recommend this game too anyone who be not a diehard chop at the bit fan of bg d d   will reassess as more content come out', 'this be originally a very long   critical review from the early access period   hence all the award on it    having play the full version   I can say that   despite all the criticism I still have of the game   bg   be probably the good crpg since dragon age origin   with only owlcat s pathfinder game offer stiff competition    bg   be very positively review across the board   so I win t spend time singe its praise in more detail    however I be go to keep this as a thumb down review for now   for two reason   firstly   there be a staggering amount of content that s be cut from the game   while act    be very polished   and act    be still quite strong   act    feel like a different game   and you can tell that there be major last minute change and rewrite to account for the fact that major area and significant story line be drop   there be also deep cut make to act    content that be in the early access for year    lot of small   voice act interaction which be inexplicably absent from the full release version   it s like someone ruthlessly go through the game with a cleaver and just hack chunk out of it haphazardly    secondly   many of larian s promise about the game turn out to be brazenly untrue   for example   as recently as june   larian talk about the city of baldur s gate be compose of three seamless open world area which we would be able to explore   only one of those area make it into the release version   with perhaps two third of the titular city be cut   swen make many comment about the potential consequence of engage with tadpole power    without spoil too much   that turn out to be hot air   there be a lot of talk about all the many variation   seventeen thousand    of the ending   while in truth the ending be very limited and feel frustratingly half bake   there be also some very self congratulatory developer talk about how the romance in bg   would be much more involved than just   complete quest   be reward with romance   while in truth it s no different than any dragon age game on that front    the combination of these two point make it clear to I that   something   go wrong in the last few month of development   and the game we get   however great   be a hurriedly strip down version of what it be mean to be   hopefully larian will plug many of these hole in an eventual definitive edition   and until such time I recommend hold off on buy bg    it s great and do many thing well   yes   but the whole thing isn t of a consistent standard of quality   and it s not really finish', 'astarion babygirl lemme smash edit   I m sorry I do not mean it   ill let you go at your own pace   joke aside   this game be astounding   this game

manage to introduce twist that will challenge your relationship with the member of this party   keep a powerful artifact or save one of they    indulge another in its corruption    etc     the many story line    how they entertwine around the core mind flayer plot be amazing to say the least   if you re here for the intrigue   the ambiance    the story   go on right ahead you ll not regret it    as for the gameplay   combat mostly    it can be brutal    even punish   consider how automatic save be handle   but it s still a pleasure   the format have clearly more complexity than do    main    secondary action point   limit spell point of different tier   buff    debuff galore   etc        that s part of the charm   you ll have to think as a tactician    anticipate rng if you want a chance

'I don t think this game need my review   so I ll keep it short ish for now   I say this without any intention of hyperbole    I truly feel this be one of the great crpgs ever make    I ve notice that this game be attract a lot of people who be not familiar with the term   crpg    there may be a few definition   but the one I use be that it s an rpg that you play on the computer as oppose to on a physical tabletop   such as a ttrpg   ttrpgs be game like dungeon    dragon   duh    vampire the masquerade   and thirsty sword lesbian    don t worry about that last one   ask your mom    crpgs replicate that experience and make they playable in single player with the video game act as the dungeon master   dm    this put they contrary to other rpgs like skyrim and dark soul for example   which be good rpgs also   but they don t set out to replicate that tabletop roleplaying experience in quite the same feel    that say   if you re a fan of any type of rpg   there s a good chance you might like bg    if you re a fan of ttrpgs   you ll likely love bg    the game use the d d   th edition ruleset which be accessible for both veteran and people who be new   if you re new   I encourage you to play around a bit with different class    race combination until you find one that feel interesting yet comfy and you get a chance to see the difference in your playthrough base on your choice   choice be one of the most important aspect of this game    if you re a veteran   you ll notice several small change to the   e ruleset to make it fit more cohesively in a video game   but it will still feel like an authentic dnd experience in   d   I think larian have do a great job of listen to the community and take feedback on what work and what doesn t   the result be a game that feel true to dnd but let you do cool stuff you maybe couldn t in the ttrpg version   they also try to remove a couple of annoying bit to minimize frustration   an example be that mage hand no long need line of sight    the story   character   gameplay   graphic   music   and general game design be fantastic   you win t really be play this game for the achievement   but if you do   you ll have several hundred hour of play find every secret    so yeah   there be my thought   give in to the peer pressure if you haven t already   it s worth it', 'within the last    hour of game time I ve manage to

beginning of the game be similar to divinity   start on a ship   crash to a shore   turn base fight etc    haven t encounter any bug in single player yet but game need a polish on graphic   consider it be in early access this be also acceptable   if you want a hardcore baldur s gate experience this game may not be for you   tyranny or pillar of eternity may be a well choice instead which be more loyal to old genre   but personally I be glad to see where top down isometric rpg genre be evolve to in this game   for rpg fan I recommend to buy it even in early access for other it be well to wait

  I ll start by say that larian have really get something special here   I m glad that the work be ongoing   but the progress be palpable   I ve break down my review into a couple section to hopefully give you a well idea of what you can expect       graphic bg   have the good graphic in any crpg I ve play up until this point   the animation still need work   as there be a number of cutscene where thing and character be misplace   however   environment   spell effect   equipment   character   etc    be all meticulously design and you can rest assure that larian have painstakingly make even the most inconsequential npc stand out       sound the sound design be fantastic   each spell and weapon attack have a unique sound   the ambient sound be distinct with each area you be locate in   as well as the soundtrack   the soundtrack   in general   be well compose   I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time   the voice act be fantastic   especially the narrator   the only issue that I ve find with the sound be similar to that of graphical bug   cutscene need polish   sometimes character don t properly voice their line when cue   if there be a large fight go on with many different effect at once   some new effect may not properly play either       story not a whole lot of tie up loose end story wise as of yet   however   the intro scene be phenomenal   probably the good intro cutscene in just about any game I ve play   from there   the story pick up on a grand scale   then drop you off in the starting area   you then begin to pick up the piece to figure out what be go on and how to well solve your little problem   the storyline so far as what s available in ea isn t overly complex   but the particularly entice part about it be the number of other small plot and character which lend to the main   over the course of my playthrough   I ve pick up several potential path which could ultimately be take probably close to the midpoint of the finished game       character I ll keep this one brief   but I just want to take a second to say that all of the character be very well flesh out and distinct   even simple npc s have personality which   for the most part   don t strike I as cookie cutter in any way   care have be take into write seemingly each and every character   even many animal and corpse   many action you take have an effect on your party s opinion of you   but each character have different preference   some party member   however   be a tough to nail down as to what make they happy   even after almost      hour   the personality difference between what be express through character dialogue and what change their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent       combat the combat be fun and reward   each action you take feel as if it have a distinct impact on the battle   this be partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effect   very punchy and flashy   lot of pretty color   this be also thank   in part   to the combat system adopt from   th ed   d d   the die roll   while not visible during combat   add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight   you can t just fle cantrip and spell willy nilly at random enemy and expect to come out on top   for the most part    the balancing be do well enough to allow for a fair fight   but one that doesn t hold your hand throughout and be rewarding when you win   the world design be also do so well that   anywhere a fight could possibly break out   you can attack kill anyone    the environment lend a lot of variation and strategy to the fight   the enemy be also very smart   to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you   stay frosty       exploration expand on the final point of the combat section   the world design make faerun feel alive   there be usually something to find around every corner   exploration be very rewarding   exploration be reward in a few different way   you can get unique loot   while not necessarily as distinct as title such as elden ring   there be a good variety of equipment to find    find interesting social encounter   or battle   furthermore   battle can be turn to social encounter or vice versa   the versatility in how the player overcome different situation be very well think out   my main grip with the exploration be a personal one   but it s the map   it can get sort of tedious try to navigate the world use the map   but   the exploration area be not particularly sprawl   so you win t be catch wander around look for a particular area for too long   a few important item for side quest also come to mind as be particularly hard to find   as they don t really stand out from the background   but   holding leave alt will bring up title for item lie around the area if you want to go that route       race class the current race available be as follow   drow   human   githyanki   dwarf   elf   half elf   halfle   gnome   and tiefle   the class be fighter   wizard   rogue   ranger   cleric   warlock   druid   sorcerer   warlock   and bard   larian have do a good job distinguish each race and class from one another   whether the customization option or progression   the only issue that I have be that the full phb selection be not yet available   there be subrace available for each race   each with differ characteristic from another   the subclass be all very self explanatory   if you be familiar with the   th edition player s handbook   a few name have to be change for certain thing within class   probably due to licensing issue   also no multiclassing as of just yet   curious to see if they decide to patch that one in       character creation   visual   kind of simplistic at this point   there be no slider which allow to you to sculpt the face or body   although there be a fair number of preset face   a good number of hairstyle and facial hair option   as well as color to apply   and yes   you can apply beard to female dwarf   lookin   at you   ring of power        progression similar progression to   e   except that there be several event which grant xp other than just slay your enemy   now come the main problem I have with ea   the level cap   the world be very well design and very dense   each action you take for the most part feel well reward with xp   but   a full playthrough of all the content could see you sit at   th level for several hour before complete   this be especially frustrating because   th level be when you get your second attack and   rd level spell   but the loot in the game still allow for a little more variety as it do continue to progress in power utility even up until the end        optimization I run this on a pretty mid system   ryzen         ti     gb ram   and I can hold between        fps when explore on high setting   when in a busy fight   my fps range from        ish   there be a few bug which impact functionality   dialogue not display during conversation   getting stick on a character s turn during combat   random crash   etc     luckily   these have all vastly reduce in frequency   while the gameplay be by no mean flawles   it have reduce frequency enough to where it s not so bothersome as to ruin the game for I   just depend on your bug tolerance   if you re a bethesda fan   you ll be just fine    just a final thought before I end this thing   if you just want to experience something different and don t mind play a work in progress   this game be for you   larian be fantastic at listen to user feedback for optimization to thing as small as simple tooltip   if you want a full experience   and I       would not blame you if that be the case    just wait until it come out   hope for early mid     ', 'this game in early access be more complete and run well than some triple a game in        can t wait for the final release', 'the sheer amount of option be staggering   I have make like     character just to see how thing work out differently depend on your choice   your race   your class   the difficulty be also brilliant   you can build yourself to be an unstoppable solo god   or a naked   and I do mean naked   idiot slap everyone with sausage and struggle to win every fight just for laugh   or you can just do everything the larian way with barrelmancy   I be highly critical of d d   e but larian have craft a masterpiece out of it to make it work   gg devs', 'baldur s gate    quickly become one of my favourite game and be one of the good one I ever play    in no other single player game in recent history have I invest so many hour into   start play it during early access   however not on steam   and due to it have another      hour not account for here   usually   no matter how much I enjoy the game   I just play game once   exception be game which require multiple playthrough   and play anything more than that just get really tedious and a chore to I   this game manage to bypass that   I be do several separate playthrough and have so much fun in every single one because of the sheer amount of varied content it contain as well as all the way combat can be resolve   you could say only your imagination be the limit   there be just so much to experience    I have not play first two baldur s gate game   what I have play be larian   divinity   original sin    which say I enjoy it be an understatement   still can not get some of the music there out of my head and I might slightly prefer it over music in this game   however incredible it be   and be a main reason why I start the third part   I be not at all disappointed   game more than deliver and largely expand on almost everything good do    do   you can enjoy this game without have any prior experience with the series   there be character appear from previous entry   some even can be your companion   there be some mention of event that transpire   so have prior knowledge be a bonus   but it s nothing major and you will not have miss much otherwise    first time I start the game   I just spend a few hour in the character creator   partly due to try to create a perfect character   partly decide which class to pick and how I want to play and partly just listen to its amazing music   in all this time I still do not get to experience every class   subclass and content hide behind they   not only do class provide different experience concern combat   they also give you special prompt in dialog   same as race    so for example sorcerer might be all   I be magic incarnate and you measly creature can not contain I    while also take every opportunity to tease wizard   as a paladin people might ask you to judge criminal   as a bard you can just take a break from adventure   pick your stage and perform music   you can pick it as a feat for other non bard class   but it will take a while    nearby character will come nearby and listen to you and even give you gold   it be one of the way to make gold   however excruciatingly slow one    if your really want to you could make your whole party be proficient with instrument and create a band and you can actually hear all the different instrument use by they    there be so many route you can take your character on   on one hand you can be a hero try to protect innocent   fight evil   prevent bad guy from their goal   help everyone as much as possible   not want to do anything with mind flayer   while on the other you can be the polar opposite   you can be like the ultimate evil one   you can betray   steal   kill and do thing that will leave even the game   evil character dumbfound   you can also be anything in between   game be write so well that no matter the path you take it be fully fledge and make sense   in most game do evil thing and pick evil choice be just you be rude towards other people and feel really bad pick they   here there be a certain excitement to they   they be more complex and it be like you be experience another layer of the game you be not even aware of   I think dark urge be the good way to play the game if you be mostly interested in the story of the game   resist it or not   there be so much content connect to it you otherwise miss about the story and so many little bit and piece that suddenly make sense    game be consist of three chapter   each chapter have multiple zone connect to it with a plethora of content   they be all closely interweave   meaning that say something while in a dialog to character in chapter one will have consequence with that character in chapter three   save someone in chapter one may just see that character in chapter two willing to help you with something you have a need for   or you might just find that character in the last chapter while explore house   or suppose you do not save they in chapter one or even kill they   you may just find their relative in the last chapter wonder what happen to they   or some of they might help you and make thing easy for you   you might just get quest and item you otherwise would not   but you might also miss alternate route   there be so much content it be impossible to see everything in just one playthrough   or even several    say that   first and second chapter be as close to perfection as they come while I feel like the last   third chapter of the game be the weak point of this game   compare to first two it just feel like it miss something   even though it be fill with content there be a certain emptiness to it   it just feel like it need a bit more time   for example there be ton of npc and you can speak with most   however you will just get their one line and that will be the end of it   I understand not every npc could get a full on life story and dialog   but I never feel like this with they in early chapter   they be just miss something   that say   chapter also have many positive   I particularly like how you get a base camp in a rough part of the city   but if you want to pay you can get yourself a whole floor in a tavern and use that as a camp instead   you can rob a bank   help a necromancer   or not    meet zombie   and help they instead    shapeshifter   vampire   obscene cult   even print your own version of town newspaper with you in it and read they the next day      I seriously can not recommend this game enough   if you like game   try this one   if you do not like game   try this one   rarely do a game deserve a        more than this one', 'this be much less a dungeon and dragon game be make by larian   and more a larian game with a coat of dungeon and dragon paint   combat rely less on what would make sense in a d d game   and more on thing that have be in previous larian game that weren t d d base but larian seem to be completely obsess with   like create aoe damage on the ground by break barrel    if you re look for a game that feel like you re play dungeon    dragon   e   I recommend solasta   crown of the magister   because this isn t it   this be basically with a skin   but that s not what the store description sell itself as', 'if shadowheart have a million fan   then I be one of they   if shadowheart have ten fan   then I be one of they   if

base dnd game with rng battle   I be     and new to turn base game as well as dnd   roll the dice in a video game be fun   who would have know      think of roll the dice and try to get past park place or boardwalk with a hotel and you only have          can be quite exciting    the camera and movement take a bit of getting use to   when you be traverse the map   you can move freely    but once you engage in battle you move into static turn base mode   battle mode can happen when you least expect it   save often for this reason   if you be play solo     you have a lot of inventory and spell to manage   if you be look for a rush thru fantasy rpg     this be not it    there be some humorous situation and character in the story   the art and decor in the map be quite nice   the animate graphic during battle be fun and well do    slow down and enjoy the game   look around   to the developer     well harpys I ever come across in a game   who ever design the harpy   design the battle graphic and write the enchanting luring music     make sure you keep they on the payroll for sure    pure talent and imagination and have be my favorite creature fight so far   I only wish I could zoom the camera in close to see the harpys face   claw   wing   skull necklace etc', 'out of all the awesome game       have give we   baldur s gate    still stand out and will sweep all the

as someone who wasn t familiar with the d d game   I initially find it quite challenging and the dice rolling system seem strange   the constant miss and critical failure leave I perplex   and I couldn t understand how such   masochistic   gameplay could be enjoyable    but I be so wrong   after invest around        hour into the game   I be completely hook and start experience a surge of positive emotion from the gameplay mechanic and the game itself   the level of detail and depth in baldur s gate    be unparalleled   make it a true work of art    the graphic be stunning   immerse you in a beautifully craft world   from the intricate character design to the breathtake landscape   everything be a visual delight   and let s not forget about the incredible musical accompaniment that add another layer of magic to the experience   the soundtrack set the perfect mood   enhance every moment of gameplay    but what truly set baldur s gate    apart be the it offer   every decision you make and every action you take have consequence   shape the outcome of your story   you truly feel in control   and the game adapt to your choice   make each playthrough unique and exciting    if

with scripting quest   enemy encounter   set up   cinematic    create item   spell   monster   place they and so on   I m not sure how good to review bg   in early access   and I m try to keep in mind the full release be at least a year away   I also feel like I ve be in enough ea beta to realize some thing win t change much from how they be now   I mention work on the original so you re aware I have some bias with the series   believe I   it s not worth mention to put up with troll and insult otherwise      designer mindset    be I try to comment from a designer standpoint more than a gamer   if you announce something as bg    I have certain expectation   otherwise   bg    insert subtitle name   would have be prefer   but the choice to include      mean something to I   so I ll treat it as such    initial impression   it feel like an update new divinity game use the ruleset of d d   e   it s not a bad thing   but it doesn t feel like   baldur s gate   to I   pathfinder   kingmaker and pillar of eternity feel more similar to what I d expect     designer mindset    some of the big key to baldur s gate be unspeak but always there   include try to include a great story   memorable character   quest   many choice in how you portray your character and approach thing   and a mix of real time w   pause d d combat   the lack of a real time combat component have throw I off from feeling like this be suppose to be a sequel   it be a defining part of bg at the time   whether or not you like the feature    character creation   ea allow    class currently   I love the many option of background   class and race   there be a lot of choice available   with a lot more to come which be great   I hope there s eventually more variety in face hair personally     update designer mindset    I be concern that enemy may not have variety and be limit to these    class as well   this do not appear to be the case with ea which be good   it still feel a little strange to I that they haven t try to include most of the class already   not sure if it be an ea decision or if they just aren t fully ready yet    gameplay   it feel like divinity but switch in d d   e stat   ability   skill   spell   monster and so on   again   it s not a bad thing   and it s enjoyable   but it feel like I m play a new divinity game set in forget realm     update designer mindset    this one be still difficult for I   I m not here to argue turn base vs   real time   I m just say what it be and how the gameplay feel   I personally enjoy both style   but it s not what I d expect from a game label as a baldur s gate sequel   the fact be it feel like divinity more than other crpgs and that s that    companion   so far there be    companion available   most likely one of which you will never use   party size be limit to     and you probably win t want to double up with your own protagonist s choice in class   initial impression be there be a lot of angry   bossy people in this world     update designer mindset    again   not argue if it s a good or bad thing   but it s noticeable at the moment how they re portray   it constantly feel like my party be disappoint in my action if I try to help people   and I ve only play a few hour into the game   I have no other choice of who to bring along   so yes it s a little frustrating    pathfinder   kingmaker offer someone cheerful   some morally questionable   some valorous choice and so on near the beginning   so far it feel as though everyone be out for themselves   and it s a bit hard to like they as a result they be more memorable for something afflict they   vampirism   time bomb   anger   etc    than a personality   this might change over time of course   but that s my initial impression    a big part of what make thing memorable for bg be the choice between many of your companion   learn about they and their personality and have a lot of option for party make up   choice and variety be always important   tell I they re   suppose   to dark doesn t help or change the fact it feel like there should be more option in class and personality   which I m not sure will change    try a different class   a companion die before I d even meet they   thank to enemy gang up on he   it be interesting and I m glad that conversation change due to their   and other   death   if not for another play through though   I d have completely miss out on a companion due to rng without even know it   and I have no way to help they in time   I d have no choice for my party at all if I didn t want to double up on class    skill roll   update    perception check help your party find hide thing   arcana check can help you decipher language you may not know   and roll for intimidation   persuasion and so on be include in dialogue option   I m happy for this feature   as it make I feel like those skill seem to matter here     designer mindset    I do hope they pay attention and continue to make the choice matter   intimidate a group to run away be great but not be reward any xp or anything for do so   not so much    why baldur s gate        I feel like this be the big question so far   and while I m sure they want to maintain some mystery   I guess I don t understand the choice yet   larian have already make some amazing popular game   and if they want to go down their own forget realm story I d look forward to it   whether it s in story   gameplay   character   interaction   choice though   it doesn t feel like there s any continuation from the original game currently   it might be there at some point   I don t know   but at this time I haven t see it    so far it s larian s take on baldur s gate   take the game in their own direction   that s completely fine   but let s face it   some people be hope to find more of a continuation of bg     with a similar playstyle   and not so much a d d version of divinity   whether or not you like one style of gameplay over the other isn t the point really   review should give information and opinion for those still decide if they should spend money on this game    verdict   do I think the game be worth recommend   yes   do I think those that expect more of an original baldur s gate like experience   and not something similar to divinity   would be disappoint   at this time   yes   say the game play be well for you doesn t change the fact that it be what it be   some will love it and some will be disappoint   while other don t mind either way   you should all make up your own mind at the end of the day and enjoy the game you like    I enjoy the gameplay and combat   but if I m honest   I be hope for more of a change from how it feel from divinity   I can look past it   but I know other win t   or don t want to   even with d d rule   stat   spell and name convention   I barely notice a difference truthfully    the story be interesting to I and I m excited to see where it go   the companion   while annoying   still feel unique   not generic and there s enough there that I do want to learn more about they   spell and monster look and act as expect from d d   e   there be some bug   and the game do need polish but it s still very playable and enjoyable in early access   if you want a full feature game though   with all the quest   class and balance   I d highly recommend you try to wait    I know when it s finish it will be an enjoyable and well receive game   in its current form   it be more alike to divinity in spirit than to baldur s gate though in my opinion   so I struggle to feel as though it s a sequel to baldur s gate so far other than in name and know the city itself will make an appearance down the road   that may change one day   but not today   ', 'this game be awesome   those divinity vibe     I

seal   a boss that bug and wouldn t die   mithral didn t spawn after destroy a node   etc    and it s end up become frustrating at time to struggle to get the game to do what I tell it   camera be also super wonky at stage after act     I promise I will play through the game in its entirety and give it a fair chance before I make claim that it have devolve into my bad fear and criticism after act      early access review    I have play larian game in the past   and find they highly enjoyable   I have also play both previous bladur s gate game   the franchise have a special place for I   since move around so much mean I often spend many hour on the computer until I make more friend   when larian put up baldur s gate    for early access   I purchase it   eager to support the game s development and know that I would intend on play it on full release anyway   now   after all of this time   after play all of act     I can safely say    this be a ripoff   don t buy it    the early access for this game be release in october of        this mean it be   after   the most devastating early month of the covid pandemic   when it be release   it be advertise as be   over      complete   and slate for a   late        release date   I laugh   know that mean it would be       at the late   and purchase it anyway   if it s playable and that close to completion   I ll just have to wait a bit    however   over the past two year of development   we have see goalpost move at every stage   new feature be constantly be add to the development cycle   feature that be not originally advertise by the developer   while there be a statement by larian in which they indicate that they intend on include all dungeon and dragon   th edition class and race   it be make clear that the priority be to finish the game s story first and add these feature in later    that be not what have transpire    two year of constantly add new race   class   skill   side quest   romance option   anything other than actual development of the principal game   every new feature have be great    no   really   I can not in good faith say that these feature be bad    but they be a distraction from what be important   and now   with yet again no release date and the window be move to        no development roadmap   no transparency   and the devs clarify that early access will   never   see more than the first    level of character progression and an incomplete act     the same good faith that stop I from claim the game be of poor quality also push I to say that this game be a waste of money    in the wake of all negative thread and comment be mass delete by power tripping community manager who be claim that people be   be rude   while the ride or die fanbase outright insult and lie everyone who dare to question the almighty dev team   it have become patently obvious to many that this game be not develop as people have wish for   on steam   on their discord   on the larian and bg   forum    no matter where you go   if the dev team have administrative access to the discussion   they be bludgeon all comment question the state of development into submission    this inexcusable behavior   couple with everything else that be lack from the development of this early access title   result in just one sensible conclusion    the game suck and until larian make sweeping change to its transparency and set a legitimate release date   don t fall for the pr and save your money   do not buy this game    edit   since I submit this review   they push back the release date to august instead of   early         I currently stand by my post   and time will tell if they have actually polish this game and have be spend their ea development deliver a complete product   or if they really have be put all their egg into the act    basket and now be rush to get the product out of the door like larian have do in the past', 'rpg of decade', 'I m gay', 'I and the boy have a chat with

they listen   but even over the course of a year   from first release to patch     most recent at time of write this     larian have show they will listen to the player and improve the game and the mechanic in so many way    while the game be base on the current   th edition of d d    it have tweak these mechanic ever so slightly to help convert a table top role playing game to a video game   it

  the review be update when the author play the full version of the game    baldur s gate    be good in many aspect of the rpg genre   I like such role play game as dragon age   elder scroll skyrim   mass effect   fallout   pathfinder   pillar of eternity   neverwinter   tyranny and of course both part of divinity   although regard divinity   I be initially confuse by the turn base combat system   I m more used to action rpg    but as a result   I get use to the game from larian studio and enjoy it    it be probably wrong to say that baldur s gate    be not like the previous product of the studio   but I do not agree that this game be the   third part of divinity    I have not play the previous part of baldur gate from other developer   but I be familiar with the ent and the story of the game   in my opinion   the story tell in baldur gate    could exist in the world of dnd   the game recieve not only the name from the previous part   but also the place of action   old character and their story   I believe that the balance have be meet between the old and the new    the first time diving into the game be especially exciting   the gameplay in the game be also very exciting and diverse   choose a class   race and ability for your hero give you great freedom in character development   and the system of select dialog option and interact with other character open up many opportunity for research and development of the story   in addition   the combat system in baldur s gate    be quite deep and maneuverable   you will be able to use tactical technique   magic and combo attack to deal with enemy   the battle in the game be always intense and interesting    for those who like turn base combat mode    at normal and high difficulty level   you can create a multi class character and use the ability of different class   I also want to add that I like the fantastic atmosphere of the dnd world and the wonderful musical accompaniment   and dhe detail and quality of the graphic allow you to take stunning screenshot    from the general little thing and flaw   I have my own idea about the shortcoming of the game     with all advantage of the character editor   there be also disadvantage   there be very few opportunity to create a unique character   in this case   mod help a lot      an uncomfortable camera and if the enemy be also above you   then it completely suck     the character level limit of     level be reach quickly and then you run half the game without any progress     in some battle   the ai skip move or freeze for        second     bug in some quest   result in frequent reboot     there be no clear boundary in the relationship and there be also no completeness of some personal quest   you don t feel like you have to win the trust of your companion   everyone just offer you love themselves with the proper level of approval   or without it   for example   forget in the camp companion want a relationship with I for no reason     as a result   baldur s gate    be a good strong project   a single player experience   of which there have be very few recently   I hope that larian studio will develop far and improve its

cheap way of handle thing   but   I guess necessary because   despite the class service provide for unique play of each class   there s very little replayability in this long   if you don t rush

act     luckily   larian be actively work on iron out everything and make the experience truly complete      there be some balance issue when it come to combat   gear   and class   but that s also something that will be fix over time      inventory and companion managing be absolutely horrendous   by far the weak spot of the game   it s a nightmare when you try to juggle between character   find and store item   etc   recommend use mode for this      I personally don t like that almost every companion be player sexual   it kinda kill their uniqueness and take away from the immersion when they can all fall in love with you      the game should have some kind of a codex where it will store all book and note that you find   info about character you ve meet   info about the type of enemy

take time to master     great voice act and soundtrack     make by larian studio   which have a record of deliver great game     lot of graphic stuff   include gore   nudity etc     romance and companion system     many class and race to choose from with many more to come      many bug and glitch   I personally have the game crash    time after character creation only to have to redo all of that again   this be of course normal as the game be ea and everything will be fix in time   but if you be bother by this   then walk away     early access price be steep   very steep   sell a full price game for only a quarter of the content just leave a sour taste in my mouth     your save will more than likely not work after some patch in ea   so if you don t like replay game   this be probably a skip for you until it get fully release     it s turn base   which some baldur s gate fan might not like   it s a preference thing   but worth to note    overall if you be a fan of divinity   original sin    this game will be right up your alley   I have no doubt it will be a        when it leave early access and I be willing to support the developer straight away', 'genre   rpg choice matter   this be the first baldur s gate game that I ve ever play   I wasn t that interested in the story of this game or previous baldur s gate game   so I skip they and go straight to this   I personally want to play this game to experience what everyone be speak about   the way you can approach each quest and shape the world   and for sure   it meet my expectation    the story of this game be pretty average   but no offense   to I personally all these rpgs have similar generic story   gather the ally and beat the evil    and that be fine   it s just not for I   however this game do add some   unique   stuff to these classic story   but the character be mostly bland till the third act   and I didn t care much what would happen to I or my companion   in act     the final act of the game   they become more interesting because this be where all these companion quest end   the funny thing be that most people seem to hate the ending   and I personally find it interesting   it s different   the bitter sweet as my friend dean say   could be improve of course    now let s talk about the most important stuff regard this game   there be many game where you can make choice   and where you can attack friendly npc   but what this game offer be that you can kill npc and they will literally stop exist   all quest relate to they will disappear   I for example have an issue with one boss   cause he be kill my companion in the dialogue as soon as I approach it   I have no way to save he   so what I do be that I attack he with a bow from a distance which trigger the boss fight   kill the boss and my companion stay alive   some guy even manage to kill one of the main villain literally        hour before the final duel teleport the enemy somewhere else and push they off the cliff   which cause the mission to be successful   and it s not just about killing   it s hard to even explain it   you need to experience it yourself    there be many way to approach the quest like I say   but there be also issue   for example   in act     slight spoiler ahead there be    goblin leader   whom you need to kill to save some people in the camp lead by zevlor   and the first time I play the game I kill they after speak with zevlor   and get quest from they   this time I decide to kill they first   this be good right   you can do it whenever you want   however   my issue be that after kill they and then talk with zevlor for the first time   he didn t seem really excited   he just say hey I hear that goblin leader be go   here be coin for you   there be barely any dialogue   after I meet he in the camp   he be just stand there   without any option for I to talk with he   my point be   if I finish the game again   I be not sure if there will be too much variety since I will probably do the quest a similar way   or in a lot of case the same   it s mostly if you want to be a good or a bad guy   rare be choice where you actually have to think   one of the exception be the ending of one of the companion s quest   that choice really make I think   probably one of the good choice I see in gaming   but for the first playthrough   this variety be amazing    as for companion   I may get some hate for this   I personally don t have anything against people who be attract to the opposite gender   however   please don t rub it in my face   in the beginning   I be scared I would select the wrong dialogue option because every male companion be hit on I   mage tell I   hey come here to see some magic    and I be like sure   he be a mage   he probably want to show I real magic   but oh boy   I be wrong   I immediately reload the game   however   after you reject they a few time   they stop try   but the beginning be a bit annoying   especially the astarion   the gay vampire who be constantly try to suck you   I mean your blood    the gameplay wise   this game follow the   e dnd ruleset   every time you attack game will toss dice in the background   you can t see it    and base on what number it land you may land an attack or miss   however   when you make some choice in the dialogue you will be ask to toss the dice   and the rolling of the dice will be show on the screen   which be pretty cool   if you get a high enough number you will perform what you choose in dialogue   otherwise   it will fail   this way you can talk yourself out of some fight   by get good number   combat be turn base   which I personally find pretty fun   having never play a turn base game before   the game wasn t that hard   but wasn t easy either for a turn base noob like I    it take I around      hour to beat the game   and clear most quest that the game have to offer   performance be fine until act     where it start drop a bit more   however   I can t say that I care too much   because it seem optimize enough   the atmosphere and music be really average      amazing way in which you can approach the quest and shape the world    companion quest be pretty good    fun gameplay and the combat itself    interesting end     story be average    companion be okay   but a bit bland at first    performance be mostly fine    there be some bug   but it wasn t that bad in my experience    while the ending be interesting   it could have be do a bit well    variety could be even well regard choice   in most case the choice be if you want to be a good or a bad guy   however   there be some   hard   choice which I enjoy     the main villain of act    be cringe   in my opinion mechanic wise this be the good rpg I ve ever play   there be nothing like it on the market at the moment   the way you can play the game and shape the world be just amazing   for this reason   I would recommend this game   sure   some stuff could have be do well   but in the sea of generic game come out every month   this game be amazing', 'larian be the true absolute   we re all infected but have no prism that s why we can t stop play the game', '     y       uwu',

will be rather short as almost everyone have say everything       time already    almost everything have be say elsewhere   maybe everything even   I buy this and didn t play it for quite awhile as I want to wait on the full release   watch a few streamer friend play it I decide to give it a try   this be what I ve find in     hour so far   get ready to play another    or so tonight and probably       daily for the foreseeable future    start with the con as I usually do    negative to I        the most sinful con be no stat rolling will be introduce even after release   this be bg    the first    reward those that stay up roll all night be an epic part of the game   it should at least be optional   like solasta   that s right I say it    solasta kick your arse on this one aspect   whenever I meet people involve with the development of this game   which I m sure that I will   I will bring up this topic   not the gazillion positive   not have the option to stat roll be total bs in a baldur s gate title   most people involve probably never play         or icewind dale   planescape toprment   etc   or pretty much anything d d relate ever   or maybe weren t even bear yet   whatever   bs   move on       there be some bug and glitch still which I do not think will be iron out as they could ve easily patch act one again   even this close to release   if they have be work out   character hold weapon incorrectly   ear through helmet   I see the camera move in a character head and you be look at the back of his eyeball for part of a dialogue   I jump all of my character to an area and they couldn t jump back due to a tiny fraction of a millimeter height difference and I have to reload a save an hour early   no biggie but suck and shouldn t happen    some how I bug some inventory and have    of some item    again it be a nice bonus selling but it wasn t as intend and they be unique item so this isn t a case of I be mistake   etc   etc   fine tuning be go to be go on for a long time and the worrisome part be that I m sure they be drool over all of the gazillion dlc s plan so they may never fine tune the little thing far        npc s talk to whoever be close to they   that s ridiculous because maybe a persuasion chance come up and your fighter have to do it just because he be stand close to somebody that start blab   I understand if you re control the wrong character and you talk to someone but this be different and happen often enough to be a gripe   npc start their rant and the wrong person be stand next to they for whatever kind of check be go to be need   how about assume the party be smart enough to have the good person for the job do whatever it be that come up   like several other game          maybe this be a non issue at release but there need to be a ton of voice to chose from for the player character and any custom character make   all of this time into all of the cinematic and stuff with every origin character and so far there s like    male voice and    female voice   that s right I say male and female   and funny that they take the time to make sure that the guy can pick female voice and the girl can pick guy voice but only show    of each     again maybe that ll be resolve in      day and we ll have     male and     female voice to chose from   it s just not good when everyone talk the same regardless of gender or race       that s about it for the negative   a lot could be explain well but maybe it will be a bit and it seem like they want people to learn by try   trial be fire    positive     I m not go to use a list here as I ll just do a little paragraph instead   the game be huge   as huge as they all say   my     hour I ve see probably I d guess about      of act     that s see it from only the perspective of my choice    race    class etc    this game be epic in size   they say that act    be the big so I expect non speedrun game should take at least       hour and consider act      haven t even be see yet possibly much much long   so many option with how to handle anything and everything that it d be almost impossible to see every single thing in the game   I d be surprised if anyone at larian have see it all   literally anything could give you several different option base on some optional thing you do     hour before which the choice be base on something    hour before etc   etc   it make my brain hurt to think of how much thought they put into all of the different path to do thing   a   on that and other game devs be go to have a very hard time keep up with that   voice act be great   the good that I ve see and it s all the time everywhere   they must have spend more on voice act than compete game spend on their whole budget   a   on that   cut scene   everyone know from watch trailer even   they be stunning   a   on that   art sound   everything else a     to sum it up this will be the great game of it s type release to date   zero competition on that   I m very confident with that   it ll set the bar for future rpg s so high that it will require very smart and very dedicated people to come close to it in the future   that s awesome for all gamer even if you don t care for this for some ridiculous reason   studio need to strive to produce awesome work instead of roll out cash grab every chance they get   I m no fanboy   I list my negative first   I didn t log in and just fall instantly in love   it s a process   if you play it like an rpg should be play   think about your choice   give meaning to your play through   then you ll love this game   if you want to play it like a murder hobo then you may still like it but there s probably well game for you out there    if you re consider buy it I would and do   you ll get the free upgrade after release and save      or so because of that   it s a deal at this price   I don t want to say what I would ve pay for this but if they do the early release as a free weekend or something   I would ve pay much more    if you read my whole review   which turn out long than I plan   then thank you for your time even if you don t like it or don t agree   comment be on for praise or flame   I m off to play it so take what you will out of this one   there s only a couple of game that I ve feel this good about and I still love and play they so I know this will be a long term love for I   even without the f

past    year    spoiler free    summary   I don t play story game for very long   if it s    hour long   I will play it for    hour   even if it s a genuinely amazing game   there be no way to re experience my first interaction with a title I love   any rerun would just dilute my memory of it    that say   this be different   this isn t just a story game   this be a narrative masterpiece   mechanically almost perfect and the single long amount of time I ve ever spend on a game of this nature   I struggle to keep hooked on high fantasy but this game exceed every single expectation I have from the genre    in short   the game be a turn base rpg   with dense player interaction   dialogue   story   and an absolute treasure chest when it come to variety   the combat be practically a sandbox   only limit by your creativity when it come to turn goblin and human alike into a puddle where their torso use to be   you re immediately give a fairly substantial task upon first loading in and it s your goal to progress through the story with the aim of resolve it   however   the step you take along your path to resolve it entirely shift the dynamic of whole region and thus how people treat you as you progress through the story   eventually   the major task you have become a footnote as you re throw knee deep into something much large than you ever anticipate   of course   how it actually do resolve   whether for the betterment of everyone you ve meet along the way or to achieve absolute power be entirely up to you    but you might often find yourself make choice with a special party member in mind      oh and the co op be absolutely unreal   it from experience   with a good host   work absolutely perfectly and I ve essentially complete the entire story    time with entirely different group of people   each time yield its own absolutely chaotic outcome   it do seriously impact how you interact with companion though as there be a limited number of party slot   so don t take your co op play through as your sole experience of the game     phenomenal writing   it s very easy to dismiss the companion you find along the way as be relatively abrasive or otherwise unintereste   but as you progress through the story they begin to open up to you as your relationship   dictate by your action   through dialogue   interaction with the world or quest outcome   grow   and thus you gain major introspective with the character   every companion have their own quirk   something that they personally want to resolve by the end of the game   if you choose to ignore they they may never achieve that without your help   and potentially abandon you   or bad   they all react differently to how you roleplay your character   some despise sign of empathy while other seriously admire it   it create a situation where the dynamic of your party isn t always rely on you pick the   morally good   answer to get a desirable outcome    ahem starfield      some companion even outright love evil act   and will encourage you to do they    oh and of course there s romance so that s always a win if you want to romance someone with the bloodlust of a bag of angry hornet    additionally   the non essential or non playable character you find beyond your own party be all intricate in their own right   some be a little sparser content wise than other but everyone typically always have something to say   often in regard to event you ve cause or partake in   even if you don t cross their path early on   they often show up with unique dialogue later   often remark about how your action lead they to where they be   something I especially enjoy be that often you ll keep see character you save or aid throughout the entire length of the game   gradually find new way to give aid back or just give you a little insight to story each time you find they   a very notable example   without share too much detail   be save a character in something I originally think be a throw away gag   where if you choose to   or accidentally   kill they just by push the wrong button   it not only lock off a major outcome of a literal end game quest but make another entire quest line marginally hard   your choice do matter even if it isn t immediately obvious    finally   the   bad guy   in this game be probably my favourite in all of high fantasy medium   and while there be an imply major boss that you re seek out   there s a multitude of equally plot essential boss you find with their own backstorie   and beyond that   even the non essential boss be all very fun to fight   all with their own gimmick which invite you to switch up your playstyle    plus   j   k   simmon   the voice of cave johnson   omni man   stanford pine    the yellow m m for some reason   and basically hundred of other character you ll recognise voice my single favourite boss in the whole game     dense   utterly dense   pack with scenario   people to meet   people to kill   people to revive for reason of question they about who kill they   quite frankly       hour of content be barely scratch the surface   I m do a brand new run as of right now and still discover thing I ve never see before   there be a deep level of world build   both direct and indirect   physical and imply   entire region be impact by action deliver long before you even arrive   some be more dangerous than other for explicit plot reason   there s little story and quest to be find in the most obscure of place   each with differ outcome    I don t think I could ever do the story justice in this section so I win t far elaborate   experience it yourself     really not what I expect when I first get into the game   I be a little sceptical because I don t much care of the rpg formula of have all your action as little button at the bottom of your screen   I especially didn t think I would much care for a top down turn base point and click style experience    however   I be genuinely captivate   it isn t just a combat system   it s a sandbox   every class drastically change how you approach issue   from get the perfect position to fireball as a squishy wizard sorcerer so you don t die first turn   to just paladin charge face first at any inconvenience   and it hit it with a   ft sword in the name of your oath for vengeance   if you re not satisfied with just play a singular class   you can then sub class and create absolutely insane build   my personal favourite being throwzerker   a barbarian that can practically insta kill most target by across map throw other enemy at the targeted enemy   alternatively you could just ignore the class system and be a barrelmancer   use explosive of various type to essentially ignite entire battlefield and inconvenience your whole party   there s legitimately no end to it   if you want to play the game a certain way you probably can   it s absolutely dnd in nature    the fight can be quite hard at time   but only if you re unprepared or have a poor party dynamic   sometimes just find the right gear can shift a whole fight in your favour   even potion I find be incredibly important as some of they can essentially triple your melee damage or let you heal after every kill   the game want you to experiment   go nuts      tl dr I could go on for hour about this game   I ve barely scratch the surface with this review   but it really be mostly just a letter of love for this game   you win t ever get a good clue of the experience you ll have just from my text   so genuinely try it even if you don t think it s go to be your thing   and well yet   try it with friend   the co op experience be so insanely fun', 'this game return a piece of I that I hadn t feel in a long time   it give I so much comfort   when I m sad I ll load this game up

larian be a poor choice to continue this franchise   not because they have ever be incompetent but because in my opinion there have always be well storyteller and baldur s gate be always more about story and character than it be about gameplay   no one can argue that larian s approach to the mechanic of their game have be anything less than groundbreake   divinity original sin      set a new bar for different way to do thing both in combat and in term of choice and consequence   and yet I ve never be fully draw in to either game because I just didn t care enough about the narrative   I always think that despite be good game they be overrate and overly gush about by a horde of fanboy    and this be my mindset go into bg     then you have the first area which find you in a mind flayer spaceship and my first thought in early access be   ok larian have do larian   I m sure it ll be good but in the end this will be another game I m not keen on   it s not a baldur s gate game    after just a couple of hour I be experience the first hint of how wrong I be    about everything    let s start with the basic of the overall technical value   in true larian form there be multiple way to do thing but they have take what they be know to be good at and improve every aspect tenfold   every large quest and even most   side   quest have so many different possible approach that it would take thousand of hour to find every secret the game can present but this alone wouldn t normally do anything to change your general experience of play a game   it never feel like a slog   never feel like you be do anything just for the sake of it   every npc be fully   d render and voice   there be no   fill    no crowd where people be just wander about to illustrate a mass   no one you can t talk to   no one that have nothing to say   the fact that this extend to wildlife and even dead body make it all the more incredible of an achievement   the graphic and the voice act be of a standard beyond any other party base rpg ever   I m aware this sound like exaggeration but trust I it isn t    so   narrative and characterisation   I m go to be quick about this because there s no way for I to give any example without spoiler   any detail you hear about this game   any stream   any walkthrough   perhaps even any screenshot   be a spoiler   thing fit so perfectly from a tale telling perspective that there be no side quest    just short story within story   there be many character that you will love and more that will annoy you   what s important be that the main one be fluid   dialogue will change your opinion of someone who be previously annoying you so much that all you want to do be take their head off   these be not cardboard cutout   they barely feel design script at all   sure the game be full of set piece and boy be they a treat almost every time    the game world be huge and pack   you can barely take a few step without run into something unexpected or another

whenever I think about dungeon    dragon I ll think of the way it s present in baldur s gate     this be the ultimate representation of this universe to I    the good comparison I can think of be the peter jackson lord of the ring movie   something that totally eclipse the source material in every possible way    cast   character   visual   script   everthing    I recommend this game to everyone',

instal it on his stone tablet and he start play   by the end of the week he have     hour on this game   this be horrible for I   as it be already hard for I to find way to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch porn   so I decide to make a twitter account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game   pick my character and

return to form consider how long ago its predecessor be release   it s hard to put into few word   but larian have manage to culminate year of experience with careful and well think out design choice that have result in something artistically beautiful and narratively compelling   all with a surprising amount of freedom in gameplay   having play many game in my time   I find that usually something have to be sacrifice in order to excel in any particular area    however bg   have exceed all of my expectation and then some   it s be a very long time since I almost feel sorrowful that the journey come to an end   but I be grateful having have it   I think both the development team at larian and the voice actor have do a superb job in create this masterpiece    I could never say something be perfect   but this be close   minus a few bug and glitch here and there   it s almost expect when a game be as wide and deep as this   for example   the bad offender be certain companion throw themselves at you   which almost feel buggy at time   one particular occasion I have to turn down the same party member   gale   down    time   and sometimes the dialogue option seem way too overly harsh   it might simply be a double edge sword where modern game need unisex romance option   however it make more sense that our adventure party eventually become good friend   I ll always consider mass effect s shepherd    garrus friendship to be one of the good     some of the good voice act I ve hear yet in a videogame   stunning visual and a beautiful ost to accompany your adventure   almost too much replayability with the slew of available origin character to choose from   satisfy combat allow for strategy and freedom of gameplay   a sheer mass of content to explore and enjoy   genuinely lovable party member    even the one I wasn t fond of still feel like friend     act    feel slightly more rushed and less polished than the previous act   some dialogue feel hamfiste and several romance option in particular seem force upon you out of the blue   I feel this could have be improve with more obvious   start romance   option   some bug towards the end of the game regard small choice make early in the game   but nothing too major', 'my attack miss more than my brain miss serotonin', 'I buy this game in       because the character creation look amazing   like what I enjoy from any rpg   with lot of option to make the kind of character I choose   and I wasn t disappoint   the developer have make progress on make the game more stable and add content and it s slowly come together to make what look like an amazing game   the companion aren t the easy to get along with or relate to   but they re not bore in any sense of the word   the only real issue I have be the dice roll   I m personally not a fan of a lot of rng in game   so fail a check to complete a quest or get extra dialogue to get the outcome I want be a bit frustrating   other than that I have no real complaint   the game be pretty fun   I wouldn t recommend it for low end pc since the world be beautifully make   but graphically tax', 'this be hard   and I really wish steam have a neutral review option   because for the most part I really like this game   but it still need some work to be fully presentable   the game be buggy   really buggy   quest flag not clear or be set properly   the game teleporting character and think thing be where they be not   simultaneous turn for enemy and ally at random   npc stand around do nothing for ten second or more during their turn   etc   but the game have a big issue   act    be a          mess narratively and structurally   there be no flow or coherence to the level design and nothing to indicate a proper quest order   this be partially a problem throughout the entire game   where you could miss out on important quest or npc by simply not notice they before reach a point of no return   but in act    it really come to a head   the story totally fall apart and there s no sense of what should or should not be prioritize or focus on   bad still   the game sometimes lead you to believe thing well save for later should instead be do very soon   for example   for some reason this incentivize the player to b line for one of the final boss at the very start of the act and ignore all associate side quest   while they be still underleveled   this be exactly the opposite of the behavior you want to encourage in player in crpg    I know these criticism will be hard for larian to hear   especially because fix they will more or less require a total overhaul of act    s story   quest formatting   and considerable change to level design   and I m not hold out hope for any of that   but it need to be say   by all mean   buy the game   but know that it fall flat on its face in the final act', 'prior to bg    I rarely play video game   the most consistent I have even be with a game be hade on switch   but what I be   and still be    be an avid ttrpg player   and a d d player   all       hour of critical role   yup   dimension     also yes   I love the collaborative nature of game   of explore what be possible   and the telling of a good story   I have hear a little about this baldur s gate game come out from friend who play ea   see some clip online   and then on release   I see it everywhere   there s a big cross over between bg   fan and d d fan   surprise no one   I didn t have a gaming console that could play it   see above   the switch    nor a laptop good enough   my laptop could barely handle three open window at a time    and I assume this would be a game I couldn t play for a while   I be curious about it   as I hear it replicate d d mechanic well and that combat be turn base   one of the thing that I have be intimidate by other game   I ve try skyrim and botw   and let I tell you I m not great at real time combat   seem like it would not be a problem here   my curiosity be well and truly catch    then come I stumble across a reddit post about if you could play it   and find the geforce now service   I figure I would sign up to a low tier   get the game   see if my laptop and internet could handle it   and go from there    well   that be back in september        it be now february        I have over      hour   two complete campaign   and well on the way to finish a third   and I now own a gaming pc capable of play it without geforce now   to say it change my life and open up a whole host of experience   really doesn t do it justice    bg   be not only incredibly gorgeous in the graphic   it be full of heart and story in a way that take I by surprise   the countless solution that be available to the present problem blow I away   seriously   I would love to peak behind the cover of what those planning meeting be like     how creativity be constantly reward by unique and fun dialogue   I m still find   new   thing on every play through   still talk to friend old and new about different way we ve approach problem   and I still be so engaged   not only that   the writing and acting of every companion   tav   and npc in this game be incredible   I ve learn about their story   feel their success   cry with the ending of character arc as if they be my own   I have be face with choice that make I reconsider everything I know about the game   make I examine my own reaction when play through the lens of another character    yes   it have turn base combat and that be absolutely a feature and a highlight of the experience   there be an incredible amount of choice across class   background   and race that let you craft a character to your liking   and then reward you for play into that character   there s loot   and meta joke   and moment that show you a team of incredibly dedicated human put so much care and love into craft the good come they could   the feeling of capture a real d d game and put on the screen be hard   and I think the team do a fantastic job at realise that experience    this game also get I through some incredibly tough moment at the end of        it s escapism and joy and I can not thank the star that align to bring it across my path   the community that have grow around it in online space be a delight and bring connection at time when I need it    larian deserve every accolade it have be award and then some   thank you for this gift', 'I guess these      hour tell the story well than anything   this be not only the game of the year   but probably the game of the whole decade   yes   it have its drawback but still     the story be amazing   dramatic   overwhelming   I can not stop play even after the sweet end   I need to see each and every storyline   side quest   npc   all of they   larian   you re      genius',

have play          most have    baldur s gate    should win steam award', 'to preface   I be what some may consider an old head of the game world   I be an avid fan and be alive to play baldur s gate    and     neverwinter   icewind dale   etc   on their release   basically any and every   old school   rpg old and new that have exist I have most likely play    my opinion     hour of gametime    this be a modern form of baldur s gate at an immediate first glance in game   sure it have the divinity flair but it isn t over bear at all in my opinion   if you be whine about the   lack of dark aesthetic   or it be too   divinity like   well you be probably right and most certainly with the divinity comment   however the game be larian s shot at baldur s gate and it be there vision   and its also on their engine so what ya get be what ya get   myself I just want another baldur s gate game to come out after all of these year and I mean for the story   I could give a       less if the game look like the old bg or something new   I be here for the story of a bg game   and larian be the studio I think could get the job do   I don t know if they have deliver but I like what I have see so far   my only complaint be I very much despise   e rule but hey what be ya go to do   ill manage with what I be give    continuation of review   so my party and I have not         extremely far yet   however   my    man campaign have         the farth   I will say that this game to I feel like pen and paper dnd very often   I have spend part of the game have absolute garbage roll on my skill check or attack roll   and other time I have string of godlike roll   when the godlike roll come it bring that sense of joy and those        ya   moment that table dnd bring   I definitely also feel that I can at least play my character the way I want to even if sometimes the game limit you   although I will say that be the price of play a video game compare to pen and paper   I do not feel that the companion lack individuality   I honestly can not stand lae zel as a character   not that she be badly write or anything like that   her attitude just irritate I I feel some may be able to relate   on the other hand the smart ass shadowheart be a character I enjoy have in my company   she can be a pain in the ass sometimes but the character personality be something I get along with   overall   every time I finish a session with my friend I can t wait till we jump back in   I see this not change when the rest of the content come out   I also enjoy what I assume to be the random event that happen during the camp action but I don t want to detail what have happen for I yet    pro   be able to use food item to heal and not have to rely on health pot be such a great thing   the story up to where I be at be enjoyable   I enjoy the roll and skill check system   it be close to dnd for I and give I the same joy   the world be beautiful even if it isn t   dark and damp   like the original baldur s gate game   the skill target for I be a huge improvement over d os    no long must I worry about my party member make dumb mistake and hit the ground because they click too fast    complaint   lae zel can go pound sand   not have a paladin make I want to weep   I wish that the ai could be set to auto sometimes and they will just do their thing   I don t want this to be all the time but in a lot of case the ai can be do their own thing in combat   one bug that do bother I be a graphical error when ai be kill   sometimes their ragdoll will flop on the ground like a fish and in many case when it stop move it s scaling will go absolutely bonker and sometimes will cover half of the map and look like thin plane of stretch garbage   I expect this to be fix though eventually    verdict as of now   if you be iffy about spend      on a ea title well you should be with all the sewage in the storefront these day   but the process be the same as what it be in divinity s ea and I will literally put my entire life saving into the pot of larian finish the game and its a quality product   if you be iffy though just wait for the game to fully release it isn t the end of the world   if you don t like dnd or have never play a game where roll actually effect your game progress and story then you win t enjoy your time   I see many complaint in the discussion and on the forum of folk wish that their character could just hit every single attack and never miss   I believe people of that mindset will not enjoy this game anyway because eventually it will become boring   companion you meet and character you interact with may not like your character because of a miss check or your character personality   so if you don t want to be a save        and expect to see all content on a single play through you probably win t get to experience it all in one go   on the opposite end if you enjoy dnd at all you will probably find this to be a good game for your money when it fully release   if you like storytelle and don t mind if the baldur s gate you know and love be make in a different way you will probably enjoy this game    that be all I have for now   ill probably update

into early access   with the early release be sometime in        which would be over    year of early access   this be the gamble that you take with early access   and I do not think you should make it   so far larian have be pretty good about patch and communication   however with the release date look to still be far into the future   I can not recommend you spend money on this right now

story fall apart   there be a ton of cut content for it   like the entire upper city which be miss despite be talk about a month before release   one companion be literally miss a chunk of her

be well practice and make similar turn base game since        so they have have a lot of time and datum to master it   and it be noticeable in this game   the combat be a masterpiece   there s so much you can do in combat   why not just pick your monk up as the barbarian and throw he into a herd of goblin and let he do everything   your imagination be the outcome of the battle   but maybe build and not know what to choose can be scary if you have never play similar strategy game or dnd   then don t worry there s a bunch of help online that tell you how to min max or get a good and fun build   and if not   just pick the stuff that sound cool or fun   a simple stat increase do a lot    the dialog be just amazing   I don t know how many of you play divinity origin sin     but for those who do

perfect   honestly   all the voice act in the game be just chef kiss   it s amazing and help you get into the role of the character   ill link a short video of some of the voice actor so people can praise their amazing work     a key part of an rpg be to be able to get into character   and this game do an amazing job help you and let you get into character   you start think like they   figure out their solution to a problem   or how they would act out in a scenario   and the interaction between the character in your party be just amazing   and romance be key   there s something for everyone   be you a top   bottom   switch   masochist   or anything else   no problem there defenetly a way for you to state it   I get peg in my play though and throw around like a wet towel   but the romance isn t just the bird and the bee   it s intimate and open to the character   where you get to learn more about they and the insecurity   motive they have   and you can t act on they   help they with it or use it against they   it s all possible   and honestly   the romance be just really heartwarming   be play as the dark urge monk my first playthrough and see the person my character

already have all the available cantrip at this point    also sometimes any companion you have with you might bug out and not let you ask they to leave the group   to fix it we have to kill the character   head back to the camp and pay the      gold to ressurect they   it reset the character and we be able to swap they for a different companion after that    despite all of the issue at the

welcoming for player who be completely new to the d d aspect of the game    the depth and complexity of the d d mechanic can be daunt quite a bit at first   and it take some time to fully grasp the

favourite   especially those which take place in a fantasy theme world   the original baldur s gate be the first rpg I ever play   and it lead I to many more amazing game franchise include icewind dale   neverwinter night   eld scroll   dragon age   witcher   and pillar of eternity   I play bg     multiple time in the early       s   and I play the enhance edition of both game shortly after bg   be announce    so like many player   I ve be very excited about baldur s gate     unfortunately   this be not the masterpiece that I hope it would be   while there s a lot of good content here   there be also a few problem which reduce my enjoyment    combat     the player control a party of    character in turn base combat   each character have action point to move   attack enemy with melee or range weapon   cast spell   drink potion   and more      there s a wide variety of enemy to fight against   and boss have unique ability which pose an interesting tactical challenge      I didn t enjoy act     play on balanced difficulty   the middle of    option    despite the name   its actually unbalanced and frustrating   the big reason for this be because most enemy   even the weak minion   can attack    or even    time per turn   while my character could usually only attack once   this feel even bad when I fail the dice roll   make my attack miss or do very low damage      the only way that I be able to get past some fight that include       enemy be to exploit the brain dead enemy ai by go into stealth mode   perform a ranged attack on the close enemy   then retreat into the previous room   which would usually cause only      enemy to follow while the rest stand around ignore the fact that their friend just take a fireball to the face   kill they in small group   repeat until the area be clear      however   I m glad I didn t give up   like I do with divinity original sin   another frustrating larian game    because act    be much well   the turning point be when my character reach level     my fighter and barbarian companion gain the ability to attack twice per turn   mean I could actually match the damage potential of the enemy   and like most rpgs   the more you explore   the well weapon and armour you ll find   which help to provide more favourable dice roll   finally   I be able to win fight without use crazy exploit tactic      by the time I arrive in act     my character have gain more powerful spell and ability   and my party reach the maximum level of     around     hour before the end of the game   after which I actually feel a bit overpowered in some fight       the character creator have lot of option for class   ability   background and visual appearance   you ll also need to create a second character who be include in the story in a very clever way      the interactivity of the world be quite impressive   character and object usually react how you would expect to a spell or an action   you can talk to animal and dead people to gain information or amusing story   enemy can be push off cliff to their death   you can use a teleportation spell to reach otherwise inaccessible location   if you ever think   can I do this     the answer be probably yes      you can spend inspiration point to reroll fail skill check while talk to npc   for example try to persuade they to help you   or while pick lock and disarm trap    you can t spend they during combat unfortunately    you ll earn inspiration point by perform feat that match your character s background   for example   as I be a folk hero   it usually involve save npc from danger   your companion can earn they too   allow you to spend they quite often       story be excellent and involve a powerful enemy whose plan pose a massive threat to both the safety of the world   and your party      many quest give you the opportunity to choose which faction or character to ally with   lead to multiple ending   while I be try to be a hero   save the world and as many people as possible   I think there s a lot of potential to be evil or power hungry      cutscene look quite cinematic   and I like how a narrator describe key event instead of I have to read page of text      dialogue be very well write and voice act be top quality      companion have interesting personal quest which usually link back to the main quest   I especially enjoy shadowheart s storyline   while two of my favourite companion from the previous game return   eventually   and it be great to have they in my party again       it take I      hour to complete   which mean this be easily the long game   not include expansion   I ve ever play   while this mean value for money be great   overall it might not actually be a good thing   at a certain point I do start to feel like I just want it be over      act    suffer from performance issue   with my framerate regularly drop into the    s and sometimes even the    s   when move or rotate the camera   I have I        k   rtx         gb vram     gb ddr    so my pc be well above the recommend spec show on the store page   there be no problem during act    and     or the part of act    which take place underground   so it seem that the game engine can t cope with the number of npc in the city   unfortunately the recently release patch    didn t solve this problem for I   and the final battle and cutscene at time feel like a slideshow      the game have only crash twice   so stability be good      some of the follow point be minor   but they happen frequently enough to become very annoying   and just make the game feel unpolished   which be surprising consider how long the game be in early access   if this be a short game I might ignore they   but imagine how often these thing happen over      hour      when navigate the environment   sometimes you need to jump over gap or to reach platform of a different height   companion pathing isn t great when do this   sometimes one of my companion would not follow   which would make I have to stop move   ungroup   so the rest of the party didn t jump back    select the   stuck   companion   instruct they to jump   reselect my main character   and regroup before continue forward      the option to hide helmet so that you can see companion   face during cutscene need to be toggle individually in each character s inventory screen   and it reset every time a companion be swap out of the party   some of the helmet which provide the good bonus obscure the wearer s entire face and look quite ugly      main quest   companion quest and side quest often link together   and progress one quest will give you information relate to other quest   however   sometimes note would appear in my journal give I information that I shouldn t have know yet   especially in act        during cutscene   sometimes my view of the speak character would be block by scenery because of a strange camera angle      during combat   sometimes an attack animation would play   and then there would be a delay of several second while the game calculate the damage     as a massive baldur s gate fan I really wish I could give an overwhelmingly positive recommendation   but for I baldur s gate    do not live up to the hype    while the excellent story and interesting character motivate I to keep go to the end   there be major problem with difficulty balance in act     and technical performance in act     in addition to several minor annoyance    in theory the problem be fixable   but for now I d suggest wait for more patch and a sale', 'here I will leave the cat   friend who pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up                l       x                                                          ', 'alright its good', 'although it s early access   there be already a lot of content   it take I      hour to complete everything   what I like     one have to choose dialogue option carefully and not just click on every option   also   some option with stat check actually lead to bad outcome than option without   I mean   if you have to pass a difficult strength check to break something   it doesn t mean that it s a good idea to do that     the story be good and quite intriguing so far     companion be    well   they have their own opinion about a lot of thing   and it s not possible to please everyone   that make be lawful good quite hard   but I like that they don t just follow I silently     the graphic be good and there be a lot of character customization option     quest be interesting and most of they can be complete in multiple different way     there be a lot of way to use the environment to defeat enemy   something I really like about divinity   original sin series    what I didn t like     the game be different from baldur s gate    and     feel more like do    with dnd   which be not necessarily a bad thing   it s still a great game   I can t even say what exactly be different   maybe it s just be     year   and it s not possible to make exactly the same game after two decade     battle can be frustrating because of the amount of fire   acid and other damaging surface   do provide a lot of spell   e g   rain or tornado   and item to deal with this   but bg   doesn t have that many option    this be fix in a recent patch     exist companion be interesting   but not very likable   I hope there will be more     jumping be a cool ability   but it s a bit annoying that companion don t jump automatically when they follow you   I have to switch to each companion and make they jump   also   companion can walk straight into fire or acid   although they could easily avoid it    this be fix in a recent patch    as you can see   con aren t that significant   overall   I really love the game   it s a bit expensive   but I don t regret spending     euro for it    as for bug   I ve encounter only two so far   one break quest and one quest item that I wasn t able to pick up   there be also some item that don t have picture yet and some miss cutscene   but it doesn t make the game less playable or enjoyable', 'as a naked dwarf bard who accidentally kill a squirrel with a violent punch over some petty argument   speak with all the rat in the druid camp and throw a naked party song around the goblin camp    I approve this game', 'I never play any dnd or divinity sin    I do not even know what c stand in crpg    all I know its iam in love with this game and nothing have be captivate I lately late game have be w   and mass effect and those be year ago', 'this game be not affiliate with wizard and do not deserve any hate regard their ogl disaster', 'be really look for to this title give past baldur s gate title   with larian studio behind it   and their success with divinity     it wasn t hard to imagine this be a nice match for the d d system   and nice it be   I very much look forward to see this game in it s final form as already it s shape up to be a wonderful game    post release update   having fully play through the game once and look to do it again soon   I can without a doubt say larian do a masterful job convert the world of d d into a enjoyable game   with a rich story   great soundtrack   wonderful character   and plenty of twist and turn it truly feel like an epic campaign', 'so   I finally finish the game   it be a great adventure   I be positively surprised that I could do a quicksave during the last fight   since I have to repeat it several time    first I would like to mention the good thing   graphic be great   the story be well think out   you have many option to choose from   eventhough sometimes the option be a bit too different from each other   but some people may see it as a good thing   the environment design be beautiful   the battle be get more epic as you progress through the game and the game be not easy on the easy difficulty   which I choose   because I feel overwhelmed at first   since this be my first baldur s gate game to play   and of course I can t forget character creation   which be awesome   I didn t romance a lot of character   because I skip a lot of the dialogue   but the romantic scene be satisfy   and I could probably say a lot more positive thing   which be mention in other review    there be also some negative   which be hard to ignore   especially in act     sometimes when I go with my party through a street that have people in it     of my character sometimes just stop and I be only able to control my lead character   and it take quite a lot of time for they to get unstuck   sometimes I have to load a save   when I be out of patience   I would expect a game with so many positive review and good rating to not have this problem   sometimes when I jump somewhere with my lead character   the other character do not jump with I or they jump when I jump back and then they jump back and so on   this fortunately do not happen as often as    party member getting stick in a crowded street   sometimes the street isn t even crowd and they stop anyway   what really disappoint I be quest management   yes   the quest page be simple   but there be no option to track a quest and all the quest marker be display on the map and it can be confusing to know where to go   some people complain about inventory management   but so far I have no problem use it    overall   the game be very good   there be so many thing that be do right   that it be not hard to overlook the problem   I might add some stuff later after more playthrough   since I would like to get all the achievement in the game    thank for read   ', 'game of

full release   but my curiosity get the good of I and I m glad it do    I think bg   do an excellent job continue the crpg tradition that start with the original baldur s gate game and continue with neverwinter night    and     and in my opinion culminate with dragon age   origin   after which I think the genre take a turn for the more cinematic and abandon a lot of its role play aspect     bg   do something great that hasn t truly be achieve before   it create an incredibly faithful translation of tabletop d d   while there be compromise   this be the first rpg to give you the ability to improvise in combat in a way somewhat similar to actual d d as well as give you numerous option of how to handle each encounter   the game reward plan on how to deal with encounter   this be exemplified in how I could scout for the good route into a goblin camp   sneak in and shove a goblin lookout off of a cliff to its death   every encounter feel unique and doesn t feel like fodder like many rpgs in the past    bg   be one of the few rpgs where I truly enjoy the combat enough to not want to switch to the   story   difficulty to focus on what I really love about rpgs   none the less   the story seem strong so far   well than the original campaign of nwn    on par with da o and maybe even well in that it doesn t feel like your typical save the world plot   perhaps not quite as unique and interesting as nwn    mask of the betrayer   however   it do share one of mask of the betrayer s good aspect   a personal story   your main goal be to cure yourself of the mindflayer tadpole   similar to motb s curse place on the pc   the game demonstrate a mastery over forget realm lore and be steep in it at every corner   judge the story far be difficult as this be just early access at the moment    the companion be engage and each feel that they be their own independent person who isn t just there to blindly follow the pc   there be add realism in that the companion be often at odd with each other as well as your choice   however   in ea some companion seem to have be give much more attention than other   shadowheart have ton of dialogue to explore while other have little to work with   I expect this will change with full release    while the level design be a huge advantage in make combat encounter unique   it s weakness be that I think it harm exploration   at time   bg   suffer from the world feeling cramped and overwhelming   there s so much pack into each area and these area be cram together   I find myself miss the occasional map transition from old crpgs to break thing up as well as slightly more open area   however   this also could be a weakness of the camera angle which I feel that I haven t full master yet when out of combat   this be the big carryover from divinity original sin    the game be relatively stable for early access   the big bug be occasional graphical glitch in dialogue   the rare enemy getting stick on their move in combat   or   most frequent of all   ladder    originally   I be disappoint when bg   wasn t give to obsidian to develop as they do a great job with nwn    especially mask of the betrayer   and could bring that experience to the table   while I have enjoy larian s game in the past   the choice didn t seem the natural one   however   I couldn t be more pleasantly surprise by larian s work on bg

atmosphere be there   you be definitely in faerun   negative    the game be in rough shape technically still   that s to be expect with early access   the lack of integrated bug reporting feedback be not encourage   like   if you re go to release what s basically an alpha   I win t call this a beta build even when half the class aren t implement    keep the ability for player to report     the control be exactly like d os    and     I find that serie a bit overly fiddly and the same apply here   it seem almost design to make you misclick   there be so many clickable and loot able object that do absolutely nothing besides crowd your screen with interactable   it be possible to aim an attack or spell at   nothing   and activate it and there s no confirmation if you do   the cursor doesn t even snap to enemy in combat at all that I can tell   so you well make damn sure you see the hit percentage and don t wiggle your mouse again before you click   the camera be all over the place   particularly the zoom level and vertical angle   there be also different button to access your bag vs   your paper doll   which be very strange   the menu in general be a bit of a mess     relate   the amount of vendor trash useless item be absurd   not quite skyrim level   but up there   I know it s traditional but please make it so that the   ware   flag remove item from the general inventory and make it less crowded     you can t change party except during camp long rest   even when you recruit a new party member   this be not explain well and thoroughly frustrating if you camp and forget to swap   before   you go to sleep   why the hell don t you pick your party when leave camp or a city   like   every rpg ever     the party member be a bunch of unlikeable edgelord all hide some dark secret and all seemingly evil or neutral at good   I don t generally rp lawful good but if I want to   I can t imagine how you would get through this game without piss they off   two of they get mad at you for rescue a child at one point   wynn show some good tendency but also act very bloodthirsty and a little racist so   yeah   can t really say I like he much either     the quest be structure so that if you be play a low int low cha character you be generally lock into the bad possible outcome   again   this be similar to a lot of previous cprg s but could easily be address to at least some degree by integrate more type of skill check     autosave feature do not function well at all   it seem to quit work as soon as you start pick up party member    anyways   I expect more from the return of   the   d d video game franchise   hope it improves significantly    edit   thank to those who point out quicksave be f     to those say I don t get baldur s gate or d d    yes   I have play the previous game   and many other crpg s   and I ve be play d d for     year   so    sorry my interpretation differ from yours I guess   my problem isn t that the npc s be all evil   it s that they be not fun to interact with   they re just boring           who        about everything you do   and wynn s comment about goblin   be   racist   like I m not say that as some kind of value judgement on the game   just point out an aspect of the character that make I dislike he and think he s probably not good align    finally   for those say   good character will come later     ok   again   I get this be early access but the way the party be introduce sure make it seem like they be the default starting group   seem kinda weird you would have to play through     hour just to put together a group who doesn t get mad at you for not let a kid die    day    edit   unfortunately have to retract my comment that the combat feel like   e   the encounter design become horrendous rather quickly   enemy all have spell or alchemical item that make fight miserable slog require multiple reload long rest   they be clearly not design off of   e monster as they use multiple class ability that they normally would not   to top it off the boss monster all have multiple action a turn on top of a large horde of minion   with a party of only    your action economy deficit be way too high to be efficient with your own attack   and with larian   rage hard on for persistent acid fire effect on every inch of the map   it s really tough to position well either    also   give everyone the ability to disengage as a bonus action seem ok at first   but in large fight it completely negate the ability of melee character to lock anyone down   this need a lot of tuning and they need to start by read the damn monster manual   if you re go to use   e math for the player   you get to use it for the monster too   the monster have infinite aggro radius and combat never end even if your entire party be hide or mile away   so    once you be in combat   no way out til all the monster be dead or you be', 'baldur s gate    you might not be able to explore       different planet in baldur

different ending and tie up some major loose end   I would estimate that a completionist playthrough would take well over      hour   a quick playthrough of the game would likely be        hour   and would be difficult to achieve on a first playthrough without miss significant content   I do appreciate that larian be willing to allow the player to miss significant content   they be leave   excess value on the table    which be the real mark of a generous and passionate developer    my first playthrough be a dark urge background character   where the character be overwhelm by murderous impulse and cripple by amnesia   the number of different outcome in this character background alone be absurd   the number of alteration to quest base on my class alone be absurd   the number of different game altering choice that I be allow to make   both to hinder and help I   throughout the game be absolutely insane   truly   no two playthrough will be alike   the only way that one could have an identical playthrough be if a save be duplicate    I have only a few small nitpick      the ui leave something to be desire   particularly the inventory   I wish   pocket   have be implement   where various item would automatically sort themselves into user define category   I often find my inventory fill with scroll and arrow   with piece of armor   story item   and interesting trinket mix in   the camp global storage be a wasteland of collect junk   one time use special item   ware to be sell   book   and lore piece      I find that alchemy be a bit under utilize   I wish a more general guidebook   perhaps with specie and farm location   could be fill as the player progress through the game   a small rework could significantly improve this   I love the inclusion of the system   but as only      of player have create    or more potion   it do need some attention      quest pathfinding could use a bit of attention     often when enter leave a building   the quest marker will direct the player back in the direction they just come from   one particular quest towards the end of the game require I to look up the location of a certain     malign npc atop his rock      a turn jump mechanic would be useful when many enemy be in combat   such as during a particular encephalitic encounter   this would be especially helpful when ally or enemy be separate by great distance or

of the draw to rpg s back in the day be that you discover your party along the way   event trigger their dialogue with you   and if they weren t in your party   or weren t there for an event it be sort of oh well   the character didn t evolve   part of the fun be discover that stuff   now that be say I still highly recommend this to all rpg gamer   very well do game', 'yes              soul

despite many a valiant effort    baldur s gate    actually feel like a cinematic tabletop session   and I love it   it be the close I have ever feel a video game capture the ttrpg experience   no   I can t speak to if it s like bg   or bg    if you want something like that   they be still make new retro crpgs that can scratch that itch   the story of the bhaalspawn be already tell   so whatever bg   be go to be   it be go to be something new    this game actually make sense to I   maybe because it get rid of all the annoying paperwork that come with dnd and streamline dice roll   and unlike most video game combat that I slog through   the battle here be fun    like yes sometimes it can be a bit much wait through a slew of enemy turn   but that doesn t happen too often   instead   I find that if I want to push an enemy off a ledge   I can actually do that   you know   because the game pay attention to the environment instead of put invisible wall up   so that s cool   I can make interesting decision instead of just try to zero out an enemy s healthbox   heck   sometimes I can even avoid combat by be a smooth talk scharmer or just a real stealthy noodle    the character be well write   though   this be dnd   they ain t exactly my cuppa tea   but I come to like they more and more as I play   the only complaint I have be the same I ve have with other larian studio game   three day top and character be bare their soul   and other asset   to you   I can t tell you how uncomfortable it be to have every single party member come onto I at a certain milestone in the game   like   there be no friendship in this game   just blood   seggs   and rock n   bard   yes   I love romance   but romance   like any other story   need pace   or else it s literally just   press x to smash   and    yike    the graphic be just stellar   I love that the character move through more than just    stalk animation when they re talk   the character customization be ton of fun   I d love to see more to do with background since the devs talk about make custom main character more involved than their counterpart in the divinity series   but what s here so far be solid   hopefully they ll add half orc because I love I some half orc existential angst    other than that   I ll post a follow up on the full release   but do I regret pay full pop for this   nope   we be in an rpg drought right now my dude   and even in ea this be one of the well offering currently on the market    bottom line   this be obviously a passion project   and the devs have the chop to back it up   god bless

as far as a quest that   complete   after we accept it   give we the reward and complete it in the journal but the quest giver continue to give we dialogue as if we only just accept the quest and the

one of those game herald so highly and already so heavily review and discuss that there seem little to say that hasn t already be    baldur s gate    may not land in my top    favorite game of all time   but it certainly land in the top    most competent   well do game of all time   it s incredible what they ve accomplish and I truly believe this be a game all fan of rpgs should play   if you can t afford it now   get it eventually as you win t regret what you experience    now that say    the game be not perfect   while it be subjective and on preference   I personally do not like a single one of the character and have a hard time really mesh with they throughout a lot of their team companion interaction   especially romance   if you don t like the character   the romance feel sudden   out of place   force   and downright funny at time   that say   it s such a minor thing that don t let this dissuade you      unless you be look for a date sim in which case I have no clue how you get lose here    I also find that I wish I have more option for merchant   sell   or trade early on in the first     rd of the game   I be leave stuff behind all over because I have nowhere to offload my loot inventory   while this do track with dungeon and dragon gameplay   which be heavily involve with the forget realm world    unless you have a pack mule or cart wagon of some kind   which never happen    it doesn t make sense that you can carry that much   even with a full party of people   each with their own inventory capacity   maybe I m just a fiend for loot but it do frustrate I on a few occasion    otherwise   I fail to find much else wrong to complain about   the game be beautifully make   write   compose score   and have a satisfying end game and conclusion    I may have sleep on write this review   but definitely do not sleep on this game   it be completely worth your time and money   I highly   highly recommend it   it s earn all the award   accolade   and high praise', 'act      act    be pretty well design and interesting   act    writing and design and implementation all suck   kinda ruin everything act      be build towards too   I really wanna enjoy this but act    be a mess', 'game be steadily improve play act one once lol awhile ago   wait for full release   which should be in       that s my take on it   go to be a amazing game when its all say and do pandemic ruin a lot of thing happen soon and the community reflect that    divinity original sin    be do by larian studio and under perfect condition it stay in early access for    month   this game have way more voice over and damn near    time the word in use for dialog option to say it would release fast and get out of early access soon would be wishful thinking but if you follow the update and wait patiently you will be reward with a amazing experience I personally would give the game the time it need to become an amazing game   its the fast I want it now think that lead most game to be the sub par game we have become use to see     like a fine wine   I will allow baldur s gate    to age and become an amazing thing to dive into   here be look at a sneak peak to one of the good rpg s of               side note    early access be buy a unfinished product only buy if you be ok with ongoing development     ', 'beautiful game   easily become my top    of all time   engage narrative with so many important choice to make that really impact the story at the end   deep and intricate character   so hard to choose which one to leave behind at the camp    love the battle system   hope this game will be inspire new rpgs from now one   prove that turn base rpgs be still a much love thing', 'no sex scene for wyll   you re on thin ice larian', 'edit    I create a video review for patch      if you want to check it out I put a link at the end of this review   I know a lot of people find this initial review helpful and I hope my most recent one can help people decide whether or not they want to buy the game    so should you get baldur s gate     if you really like larian rpg game then probably yeah   it s a lot like their other game with a few major difference that might make you not enjoy the game       the skill don t have cd like in other game   they re base on   e d d so they re base on your class   so your class selection be very important and you ll need a balanced party       if you re big into d d game like I you might be frustrate at some of the larian game mechanic   like ray of frost leave ice beneath the foot of enemy and similar spell leave field on the ground that debuff or damage target   ray of frost be the big offender since slip on ice end your turn   or your opponent turn make it the good mage cantrip for its rng value    be this game a sequel to baldur s gate    and      no   so far it seem like it have nothing to do with the other baldur s gate game besides the fact you re try to get to baldur s gate to some degree but can t because monster be          around in the countryside   as per usual   your character be also not a bhaalspawn so I m not sure why they call it baldur s gate    when more accurately it should be like   baldur s gate   the mind flayering or something similar    do the game run well    depend on your machine   mine be fairly powerful and with the game ready nvidia driver the game run smooth   however texture kinda pop in weirdly   the game be in early access so it s expect that the graphic aren t full up to snuff yet    do the combat feel good    yeah   it feel pretty good they get the   e stuff in game to work really well and they add in special weapon attack that make a big difference   the combat be deadly   but fair and you have load of option to subvert encounter and crush your enemy   beyond that it s not a big murder hobo affair either you do murder many thing but I be surprised when I actually find some friendly monster who d normally be murder hobo fodder   larian also wisely shoot the alignment system of d d in the head behind a shed which be a good move since   e doesn t really use that system very much anyways   I find the ai however have a hard time handle stealth attack   where I can sometimes get three free stealth attack against monster if I have my rogue hide well   perhaps that s a bug or a reward for good positioning I can t say    how be the story    don t worry   no spoiler    story be pretty fine and the character you meet along the way be interesting   some be a bit hostile towards you but due to the situation you find yourself in I think it s       natural that your party will be distrustful towards each other and your character   however I find that even the more nasty character do warm up to you quickly   or at the very least treat you as a decent person   I read some review after play where reviewer complain that the party always hate you   but I only ever feel that one npc hate I   and now after a few hour into the game they talk to I as an ally and have even confide into I about some of their own secret make I feel like it s something that could easily become a true friendship   one praise I ll give it that other will call negative be that some persuasion option might not be good idea   please use your common sense   you might not want to tell sensitive thing about your situation to certain people or even if you pass your check it might have a negative outcome   in this case pass the check make a really bad situation a bit less bad   you also get special dialogue option due to some special magical power you get rather early on in the game though I ll avoid call they by name because that could be a spoiler which give you op persuasion option that you can not fail   however I like that the game imply that by use these power you can get some negative backlash   these option even let you learn extra detail about certain character that share your condition though I have opt not to use they since I assume it will worsen my relationship with the character   the only downside of conversation be that in single player you can t change who be talk to perform skill check   I have a dex check in a conversation to pick a lock but couldn t let the rogue do his job to pick the lock   there be also lack a dialogue option of I just use the key I have on I to unlock the shackle the guy be trap in   the animation in conversation be also fairly stiff looking and your character only have a few stance they take   they re kinda annoying and I hope they add more variety to they    so how good be the game in early access    I d say pretty good   you get a large area to explore and the character be varied and the story interesting if a bit high fantasy   though I feel baldur s gate be also high fantasy   I will say I m not a fan of certain name character exist in the world like volo who I find   but I be happy to learn you can also mindlessly murder such refference and rob their dead caracasse with only minimal consequence   I bribe a guard like      gold after I kill volo and steal all of his swag   it be super worth I d recommend murder volo in every game he s in    beyond that I d say the game be on the right track to be a cool rpg   though the game require patience if you want to avoid murder hoboe   the game give most character even goblin actual name which make talk to they and learn their secret worthwhile   I d recommend talk to as many people as your patience can handle to solve problem non violently since some fight be nearly unwinnable   also don t forget to scout around with your rogue to find shenanigan to cheese encounter and make sure you re not about to walk into a hornet nest    patch    review', 'I can finally play d d alone because I don t have friend', '   keep this in mind before you buy   the store page and devs have make it clear that this early access will be only act     limited class and probably limit to level     it will also be buggy and break at time   ea be here to get valuable player feedback and be not a full game    and trust I they listen to feedback and have improve a lot since its release    if you re look for a finished game don t buy this and don t complain about it be unfinished     but in my opinion release this as early access be a great decision in order to get player feedback and make it way more enjoyable for the full release    here s my opinion on it as it stand so far   I m a fan of   e   albeit a relatively new fan   I ve play one tabletop campaign before ea release so my knowledge of it be limited but I ve play both do   and baldur gate        and I have to say that bg   have huge potential and as it currently stand it be pretty fun and impressive for an unfinished mess    don t buy this look for a perfect clone of   e do   or bg     because its pretty different   the   e mechanic have be change a bit and be adapt in order to make the game enjoyable as a videogame rather than a tabletop   it definitely stray in some area   increase enemy health    push   mechanic   surface element etc   but I think most of the change be fair and not too annoying   push be a tad overpowered   however   as a bonus action     gameplay and interface be pretty reminiscent of do   but instead of ap you have the standard   e action reaction bonus action resource   navigate the world and chain unchain work pretty much exactly the same   personally I d love to see drag select from bg     as an option but currently there be no plan to add that as far as I know   party consist of a max of    player similar to do    but I m hope they ll add an option of up to    similar to bg     but it doesn t seem likely    not many gameplay element carry over from bg      the gameplay be definitely modernize with do   control to appeal to a broad audience and to suit   e mechanic   several character carry over from bg      some have be leak and other be already in the game   currently not too sure how much it will tie together in term of story but we ll probably see more on full release   I can understand why bg fan might be hesitant annoy at this game since bg   conclude everything but I m optimistic that larian will do a good job tie thing together   as it stand now I expect this to be more of a standalone story rather than a direct continuation from the original game    for companion you have a decent variety in ea   the current one be astarion   thief    shadowheart   cleric    laezel   fighter    wyll   warlock   gale   wizard    a lot of the current companion can be annoying but I ve grow attach to most of they   not a huge fan of laezel though   my favorite be probably gale and astarion   they be somewhat shallow at the moment and they all seem to have some   dark past   that you ll probably figure out pretty quickly into act    but overall I like they and I think they ll get more depth in the full release since larian seem pretty good about give companion good side story   several more be plan for the full release with    more leak     there be romance option with all companion currently   straight    gay option for they all I think     the big encounter boss be all pretty challenging imo   I really struggle with a lot of they but maybe that s just because I m bad   there weren t many fight that I consider a pushover   most encounter also have a peaceful pacifist option as well if you perform well on roll   there be a lot of different strategy for each fight so replay the act    encounter hasn t really         bore    early access have a lot of bug   crash   and performance issue on moderately decent hardware   idk how much more I can elaborate on that but just keep that in mind    I d go into more depth but I feel like I cover a lot of basis   I d definitely recommend play it in ea and give your feedback to make the game well but wait til release be also very valid if you just want a full game   I personally have enjoy ea a bunch and its pretty fun as it stand even with the limited content', 'welp   I have well and truly smash this game since launch   just get to end of ea content available at the moment and it have be amazing    please be advise this be early access and full of bug   it s not a full release so there will be crash   desync and bug   say that   I have thoroughly enjoy my playthrough and this have goty potential when it release imo    pro      larian have an amazing track record with divinity original sin    be one of my favourite game     the voice act be wonderful   every character have personality and the body language and script go hand in hand too     on the topic of dialogue   there be a wealth of choice and option mean plenty of replayability     new to d d   this be a great intro   didn t play divinity   no problem   very easy to learn and pick up     food and potion be meaningful   sound weird but bare with I here   you don t automatically heal outside of combat true to d d and have to either short rest   limit to    a day at time of write    long rest or eat food drink potion   I like this as it s a step away from the trash collector I normally do in other game     good humour   easter egg and in joke      camp   mechanic be fun and allow you to interact with npc     well enjoy with friend in true d d fashion    con      early access   it will crash   desync and be buggy like I say above     you can t swap character mid dialogue   eg   if my fighter be talk to someone and a persuasian check come up   I would like to hand over to my charismatic warlock   currently the game do not allow this     ea bug   character don t always move their mouth in dialogue which can look a bit weird     ea bug   some strange texture bug and funny camera angle can make it hard to see at time     ea bug   player   in multiplayer   getting stick in a fake dialogue and not allow you to save    this game be in ea   and although unpolishe   be fantastic   larian breathe

of be even great in the future   it have that much potential   it have an open story line that enable player to truly journey in a world   something I have not see since the ultima game series and its like    it be almost a   d world which be quite beautiful to explore and this will enable the game to be a platform for a vr series in the future   it would be a moderately difficult task but larian can do it as they have show the capability here to achieve something great    another great feature be that they have not contaminate the world with saturate it with pvp which to be honest do not improve the fantasy gaming genre greatly   it be very hard to immerse yourself in a fantasy world with a few good friend when you have random people walk about break the   th wall all of the time   pvp have its place but in the balance between immersion and gameplay it often destroy the world rather than enhance it   I know I be break one of the big trend in gaming by say this but if you can make opponent think and act within storyline arc then you be address the core reason for pvp be in game   I have no objection to there be area where pvp be possible be include but this should not interfere with the excellent quality of this game    another great feature be that this game be not a money grab   I be so tired of playing game where the easy way to deal with something be to pay the developer for token and item   I be one of a grow number of gamer who will not play any game where there be any element of a marketplace feature where you pay for token or item   I be delighted that I can pay upfront for this game and I would be happy to pay for expansion but please stay away from the dread marketplace feature as it just defeat the accomplishment gain through the game and the concept of risk   please please do not chase the money through a marketplace as it just mean the player be think all of the time   ok when do this game try to pick my pocket after I have invest time   where be the creature that can not be kill without my credit card detail     I will also add that the environment include the protagonist and antagonist be able to be interact with   the environment contain a fairly wide range of option to interact with and have many state   fire   cold   electricity etc    you never truly know who be support you or not and there be many hidden storyplot   if I be to make a recommendation it would be to be like get and make your world character malleable to transition like jamie lannister I e   allow transition from good to evil and vice versa    they have really hit the ball out of the park this time and I be so impressed with what larian studio have do with the support of wotc   this be an     out of     game and for those who truly wait for the

sufficiently address the negative issue I cite previously   below    the role playing and character development option have be significantly improve   create a more balanced and satisfy play

  larian   keep up the good work    update   patch     patch    be finally deliver more of the role playing and exploration I feel that the game be miss   this be a big step in the right direction for bg    I love the new backstory feature and more complex interaction with the party member   character depth get I invest in the party character   look at you   shadowheart    I hope larian have more of this line up for future development   that would make bg   a great game   and change my negative review to a positive one    update      hour of play   after more time play and analyze my experience   I think I can well define what it be about bg   early access that really bother I   it fundamentally boil down to my belief that the combat system be unbalanced   at both a micro and a macro level   for I   this lack of balance   pull I out   of immersion in the fantasy setting   I find myself become frustrate   and honestly bore   grind through combat encounter    at the micro level   the tactical combat design be unbalanced   every combat encounter have a real chance to kill one of your party member   even if your party of four level    character be fight four goblin   basic goblin enemy be give acid vial and hand grenade which be literally well damage dealer than most of the level    spell your character have access to   I often wonder why my party character should bother take damage dealing spell at all when bomb be almost always well    there be a real chance one of your party character get bomb rush and kill   and this can happen during any encounter    I think larian do this intentionally because they think it would up the challenge and make the stake feel high during combat   that be a reasonable objective   you want player to feel the stake   however   for I it have the opposite effect   death be so common place in bg   that it lose a lot of its meaning   it no long feel high stake   in   th edition d d rule   death be a significant event   especially at low level   resurrection magic be expensive   and sometimes find a non player character who be even capable of resurrection magic can be challenge   you can have player character die for good because the party be just too poor or lack access to the right spell caster   this dynamic make character death feel important   it raise the stake    and larian create this tactical combat imbalance intentionally   it be a design choice   that be evidence by how easy and cheap they make resurrection magic in bg    your player character start the game with two resurrection scroll   a red flag for I as soon as I start    the party can easily buy more resurrection scroll   and if that be not enough   you eventually get a permanent camp follower who will literally resurrect party character on demand   for a paltry      gold   whenever you need it   I think larian believe this make the combat system balance   maybe it do   but in a very displeasing way which greatly cheapen the role play aspect of decision making and life or death decision   for I   it just make character death feel largely irrelevant    the other way this unbalancing of the tactical combat system diminish the rpg experience be by make combat take forever   turn base combat can really drag if the combat encounter be not carefully design   as a table top d d player   most d d combat encounter last    to    round   and that s about the sweet spot for balance between tactically engage   creative   and fun combat encounter   combat encounter can sometimes last      round   but that s usually against high challenge rating enemy   and I mean high   like dragon and giant    the long combat encounter I have ever experience in d d be     round     against a lich   all of that be to say that a turn base combat encounter should rarely require more than    round   the fact that in bg   most encounter take     round to resolve make the combat system in the game feel like a grind   and not a fun grind   at a minimum   larian should reduce the number of combat encounter if they choose not to rebalance the combat system    all of these micro level imbalance accumulate to create what I consider a macro level imbalance   as a d d player and a fan of the original bg and bg   game   I like rpgs to have a good balance of combat   role play   and exploration   for I   that balance should be about equal part of all three   that ratio can ebb and flow over the course of the game   but they should be balance in an overall sense   right now   bg   be about      combat in term of hour of gameplay base on my playthrough   or maybe slightly more   for I   that be too much combat   it diminish the rpg experience I want   I would like to see larian enhance the role playing and exploration aspect of the game significantly    to end on a positive note   the combat system itself be fundamentally not bad   I think larian do a good job of port   th edition rule into a pc game   mechanically speak   it be a really decent foundation to build on   but by drastically change the balance of combat encounter   larian drastically change the experience of d d combat   and ultimately change the experience of

dialog be voice   scene be stage at the level of movie   in some scene you involuntarily say to yourself   wow   how good it be    it s also really nice that you can play character with a lot of

divinity series   particularly the original sin prequel   larian s game while most definitely good   be entirely different breed of crpg   besides   the throne of bhaal have conclude the saga perfectly more than     year ago   why create a sequel to a story that didn t really need one   whatever the case an opportunity to return to the forget realm be not one I could possibly pass on   time pass and baldur s gate    be release   since then it have be hail as one of the good   if not the good   crpgs ever   the bar have be set high   let s see if I can agree    the game start fairly typically with the character creation screen   it follow a tweak version of d d s   th edition ruleset   some of the tweak   include the change to character creation   be rather questionable   alignment be go and racial difference diminish for poorly define reason   another surprising change be the strangely convoluted way of pick your character s sex   which be that you don t   instead   you pick body type and then genitalia   those quirk aside   I do wish that the character screen in the game would provide well and more detailed information   it be a bit of a shame I couldn t plan my character s development without look up resource online   whatever the case   there be still enough d d goodness here to allow for some interesting character   there be also a selection of pre make character   call origin   which will become companion if they be not select   and a unique origin call the dark urge which put you in the boot of yet another bhaalspawn   that one be for a second   more morally ambiguous   run    after character creation the game begin in earnest with the protagonist capture and infect by the vile illithid   aka mind flayer   doom to become one of they   here   the game really go all out with the spectacle   amazing cthulhu esque character and area that look like something out of an hr giger book litter the prologue   adorn with epic battle as the fly ship the protagonist be imprison aboard fight its way through the hell   the game deserve all the praise it get and more for its graphic and visual design   it be perhaps the first thing one notice but I don t think I ve see a classic isometric crpg that look this good before   I m always quick to say that such game don t need to look great   just reasonably pleasant   as long as they play well   but if I can get a game that look like this and play well   that s unquestionably well   the experience be elevate far by the game s excellent music and voice act   the production value be through the roof   this be triple a meet old school do right    after the prologue   the game follow the now infect protagonist and their party   as they make their journey towards the great city of baldur s gate   on the way   they encounter more and more people infect by the mind flayer parasite and become embroil in a suitably grand conflict that may decide the fate of faerun   the game be divide in    main act   each locate in a different area   early on the player have little knowledge of the grand plot brewing in the shadow and the game do an excellent job convey this feeling of uncertainty and mystery   it bombard you with question and give few answer   which only generate more question and keep the tension high   who be your mysterious benefactor   what be the absolute   why haven t you turn into a mind flayer yet   this early phase of the game be easily my favourite   I be try to understand what be happen and explore the world around I   a world which be fill with side content that be still compelling enough to explore even as I struggle with the main plot s great question   then I finally get my answer     and I be underwhelme    arguably   the game s great flaw be that it doesn t feel like it deliver on its promise story wise   it set the expectation sky high and maintain those expectation almost till the end   but I find the final act of the game and the resolution to the story rather lacklustre   whereas early on   you be give the option to be good or evil   support different faction and see different result   by the game s final act the plot be more or less railroad you towards the same end   your early choice don t matter all that much and in fact it become rather clear that the good path be definitely well develop   the conclusion to the story   as well as the reveal of your benefactor s identity leave I incredulous and I feel that the whole mind flayer brouhaha   include the process of turn into one   be explain in a haphazard way that simply muddle the world s lore   it be a bit of a shame because the final act be easily the one with the most throwback to the old game as it take place in the city of baldur s gate itself    the character that can join the player s party be comprise of the available origin that weren t pick   as well as a few extra that come later on in the story   luckily they be for the most part interesting and compelling to interact with and learn more about   when follow the player they will also interact with the world and flesh out the experience   they will give quest   have want and preference   it be unfortunate you can only have    companion with you at a time   as it mean that much of the content of the other will be miss   I would have much preferred if all companion follow the player and interact with the world   even if only    fight with they in combat   it would be no less arbitrary a restriction   a pet peeve worth mention here be their romantic aspect   the companion be way too horny and eager to hit on the player   irrespectively of sex   here you be spend a tender moment with one of your male companion and all of a sudden you be gay   deny they and you be the bad guy   it s like non romantic friendship do not exist in this world   sigh    gameplay wise the game be   again   at the top of its game   there be a lot that the player can do and a lot of way to do they   the game often feel like a sandbox that invite the player to think out of the box and attempt solution that don t follow typical game logic   I will admit much of this be not really very d d like   the game feel and play a lot more like an original sin sequel   its fondness of elemental terrain include   just with a coat of d d paint on it   the tweak in the rule do work generally in its favour here   though I do get the feeling that original sin    could handle this kind of gameplay well than baldur s gate    anyway and I m not without my pet peeve   for example only be able to cast speak with the dead once per corpse and have your opportunity to speak take away from you if you forgot to disguise yourself first   unless you reload that be   or larian s bizarre inability to understand the value of heavy armour   nitpick aside though   the game be a blast to play   absolutely enjoyable   as well as fairly deep and rich in option    so   be this the good crpg ever make or what   well no   it s not   it s not even the good baldur s gate tribute of recent year   that be pathfinder kingmaker   unsurprisingly   this feel more like original sin    rather than baldur s gate     of course original sin be a great series   so that s not necessarily bad   but its focus and playstyle do differ   as such   this merger feel somewhat less focused   I also find the resolution to the story rather disappointing   not bad per se   just unsatisfactory   it leave I want   it s a good thing larian be still tweak the finale add extras in recent patch   maybe we ll get there in the end   be that as it may   this be still an impressively well make game that deserve to be play and then play some more   I absolutely recommend it to all fan of crpgs out there', 'play almost   hs into the early access and I don t know if I ll keep go   I mean   the lack of polish be noticeable but it be in the right direction   so I ll wait for the full release   don t wanna get in the discussion about if it be a another d os   I don t really care   it use an update version of the engine but with a d d   e set up and core rule and it really feel like a d d game   so if you frequent tabletop   e you re in for a ride   and if you re not here s an opportunity   you ll figure it out in no time   didn t get the   modern bg   feeling as I do with pillar of eternity or pathfinder   kingmaker   so in time we ll see if it be worthy of carry that name   it could well have be call baldur s gate something instead of       overall the game look pretty nice and the music be just astonishing   but again   I highly recommend to wait for the final release if you want to get the over       level of impression', 'launch day   my life outside of this game will soon be in shamble     thank larian', 'this game have no right to be so good   be it perfect   nope there some rough edge here and there   like the camera decide to focus on a dead gnome foot during an    important    dialogue that have nothing to do with that so say gnome   similar thing happen a few time   or the inventory be a bit messy to manage   but atleast you get unlimited storage space day one unlike some other big title that apparently need    month to patch it into their game but be willing to sell you like a dozen skin for      day one so it be what it be I suppose    there also some bug here and there   mostly in act    and     but nothing game breaking and give larian track record in ea I m not too worried that most of they will be fix   if they be not already by the time you see this review    the craft system also feel like something they just add in the game as some half tought    do we scrap it or not     feature but it not bad per say it simply a bit basic   it still useful tho but you do not need to interact with it at all if you wish     everything else be so minor or personal    wish     like     more face   a perma death mode   even hard difficulty   maybe an arena mode where we can get to level     even if it not tie to the story at all    and I firmly believe mod and patch will make it even well than what I expect it could get within the first few month    past that I honestly think this game offer the good crpg to date period and need to be play by anyone who like the genre   atleast grab it on sell at some point if you be not       sure about spend much on this title and trust I you will not regret it', '      can t have sex with a dragon in early access   literally unplayable   fix this larian    edit   now that I seize all your attention via a funny haha post immediately after launch   I m not joke though larian   if a donkey voice by eddie murphy can plow a dragon then it be my right to do the same   give the people what they want and be forever immortalize as   maker of that legendary rpg where you can shag a dragon    and have acquire all of your point   I think it s time to give an actual review    if you like d d   buy this game   period   I mean it   even just the first part of the game that we currently have access to be brilliantly make   a near perfect port of d d   e tabletop rule where everything run off the d    system   gorgeous visual and effect with a ton of attention to detail that larian be know for   engage writing with ton of dialogue option unique to the choice you make during character creation   ton of possible character and branch choice option for ton of replayability   even in this early stage of early access   larian be behind the game mean a very trustworthy early access period that will be utilize well and use player input to its full   meaning we ll end up with a very polished and expansive end product   actually go turn base to fit with actual d d rule instead of try to shoehorn in that bastardize mutation of tb and rt that the original baldur s gate game use and people be so blind by nostalgia they ll continue to argue be good   seriously   I see myself sink countless hour in to this game because it s the exact game I ve be wait for and dream about for year   ever since I start dme for my friend back in high school   a pc game that be just d d except could be play alone or with other and you could just make your character and have fun with it instead of need to set up play session and make sure everybody can attend    all of the above be say without consider some of the annoying bug and instability the game have at this stage   give that it s early access and nobody should be buy this game if they don t want to put up with early access roughness anyway because give larian s track record   I can play confident those bug will be fix at some point during early access    as long as larian keep up the good work and communication   work with the community like they ve do in the past   and keep up the ambition they have for this project   baldur s gate    will easily become one of if not the great rpg in existence   it s just that good', 'I lack the intellectual capacity to accurately describe how brilliant this game be in virtually every way   will be play this for year', 'in december of       I almost die in a car accident   I be so happy I survive and get to experience this game first hand   over      hour and game still feel fresh   the great game ever make', 'the good crpg since dragon age   origin', 'this be what game be suppose to be', 'let I start by say   buldur s gate    be a great game    however I have some grief with it   my main problem be its combat system   it feel clunky   stiff and too random   and it be like that   because it be adopt from dungeon and dragon   table top pen and paper game   with all it s limitation   I feel like the gaming medium allow for far well system   developer already make they in previous game    so let I go through   why dnd combat system make this game frustrating   when you try to attack an enemy you roll your chance to hit against their defence   or they roll their defence against your static attack value if you cast a spell    these roll modify by different stat of your character and the enemy   but because enemy get strong as the game progress   this hit chance be around the same number   let s say       on top of that   the damage you deal be determine by a dice roll   like                  before modifier   so it create a situation   when you try to attack   your damage be determine by a random number among                                               all    s be miss   so majority of a time you attack do nothing   or very little   and it would ve be fine   if you weren t limit to mostly    action per your turn   this mean that there be a pretty high probability that your character will make little to nothing impact for multiple time in a row    if you be play a caster character the combat be even bad   all your strong spell be limit by number of time you can cast they before you rest and replenish they    strong spell still can be dodge by enemy   or do minimum damage    this be just like in dnd   but unlike in dnd   in bd   you have combat encounter every     minute   this mean that   as a caster   most of the time   you do just normal attack because you run out of spell slot   or try to conserve they    rest after every combat encounter or two seem pretty impractical   because rest advance time in a game and can fail some quest for you    I know that the idea behind this game be to make a dnd game   and dnd fan would love it   but in my expirience   it s not combat that make dnd fun   but freeform improvise roleplay player and dm do   and dnd s roleplay isn t possible to adapt to videogame   atleast for now    so in the end   video game that try to stay true to dnd feel off to I   when you try to adapt dnd   you have this amazing roleplay part that you can t adapt to vidiogame and a below average combat system      and for bd   roleplay   it s just a branching dialogue tree with skill check   it s great on it s own   but dnd have so much more   like half of skill in dnd have aplication in roleplay encounter   and in bd   you have these skill   but you don t have a use for they   like in dnd you have magehand   illusion and other   you have countless way to use they in dnd   but while play bd    I haven t find a single use for they so far   didn t have an option in dialogue to use they so far   maybe you can use   charm friend   in dialogue   but haven t try it    I guess   my whole review can be summarise with sentence   I wish   I be play divinity    instead of buldur s gate      because this game feel like a downgrade from an amazing divinity   ', 'verdict   baldur s gate    be probably the good rpg ever publish      steam achievement       require    playthrough   the game be incredible I mean really incredible amazing story a lot of interesting character you can play as an original character or one of the premade with established lore if you want to see and do everything   you will have to play the game several time voice act be top notch one of the good soundtrack there be   especially the vocal song   final act   down by the river      the graphic be just astonish no paywall   no dlcs   no game pass ability to reroll your character completely mid game sooo much customisation of your playstyle that you will never do and see everything     no steam trading card act    and act    bug some quest if you do thing out of order which be a huge issue in non linear game an accidental right click automatically skip cinematic which suck if you be a hoarder it be impossible to organize your item in camp properly your party rarely react to anything in the last act       the game push you to save scum if you want all the lore   history   insight and other dialogue check   it would be nice to have an option to skip check on some difficulty just for lore purpose   edit   I have just finish the game for the third time   original character   dark urge and then astarion   and I have to say that I

to tear at least twice   I recommend this game so much we re buy a copy for my wife so we can play co op    launch day edit   a lot of fanboy be whingee about my negative review so I figure I should post an update    I m play on launch   I m mostly have a good time   I say mostly because while a lot of my concern have be deal with   some new one have already pop up   particularly in the space of graphic    I have a really beefy computer   I   processor      gb of ram   geforce       super   the game s instal on my    tb nvmi   and yet I can t keep     fps consistently on anything high than medium setting   this same pc be run remnant    at more than     fps on high setting during the run up to bg   s release   that be    unacceptable to be perfectly honest   this kind of optimization failure need to be fix asap   I be get much well framerate during early access at much high graphical fidelity as recently as the paladin patch early this year    I know larian can do well   and I expect they to   I m probably go to give it another couple hour of try   but if it doesn t smooth out I guess I ll be wait for an optimization patch    I be leave the rest of my old review after this

chapter be currently very unfinished despite be release for early access for some time now    movement be sticky   slow   and buggy   your ai companion will frequently take the absolute bad path possible give any geometry that isn t simply a flat plane   and will frequently make jump that hurt or even kill they without any input on your part    speak of jump   some gap and other kind of terrain that be mean to be   interesting   instead become deadly trap that require a quicksave before every attempt    the game also suffer from some design decision that clearly come off of people that be obviously work on do   before they move to bg    the sheer number of trap and trigger plate vastly outstrip either your number of disarm kit   or hp to deal with it   once those option be exhaust   your only option be to force turn base   combat   with the trap and move each character past the trap one at a time    the kind of abstraction that be no doubt mean to mimic a group around a d d table try to deal with a trap   bring the actual video game you re play to an utter   crawl     I bring up do   because the design space for that game give you the ability to   craft   more lockpick and trap disarm kit   to the point where once you have a decent amount of money and access to trader   you can get as many as you re willing to invest in   and even if you don t   the absolutely   superb   number of movement and defensive option with the game s huge library of spell and ability give you many avenue to defeat trap and lock   and if all else fails   resting be not a finite resource   and be also instant   rather than take several minute of load screen and cut scene    I think it s possible that at some point in the future baldur s gate    will be really fun   if somewhat handcuffed to it s d d abstraction   but right now I can t in good conscience recommend a game that feel very much in alpha   but charge full price   you should go play divinity original sin

with useful skill for situation just sit back and do nothing lead to a desire to save scum   it s also just straight up immersion break to have character who should be step in for something just sit back completely useless   it s the kind of thing that really generate a dissonance I personally just find grating    I ll probably push through the game on a new character more set up to be the face

complicated   rating to this game   as it stand   after finish the game and be quite disappointed with how the ending pan out   and upon research other ending   I be certain every ending would have be disappointing for I personally in this first playthrough   I can only look at the fact that I do spend      hour   and I believe that say something     the craftsmanship of act    and    shine a light on the shoddyness of act     quest will have strange resolution   the world will be less reactive and make less sense   and the game will sometimes not understand what you be do   or it win t recognize your course of action   another way to put this be I never find myself have to google anything in act    and     because like I say in the original review you come to trust that the game can handle your           and will have some resolution for your course of action   that trust evaporate in act    and you may find yourself stuck or reach conclusion that make no narrative sense    by the end I felt compel to make a horrible and unsatisfying choice   because I be the only one who didn t have anything interesting and meaningful in my backstory as oppose to the other character present at the time   I recommend play dark urge   so that you have something go on for yourself   something that be already tie into the narrative of the game    this be just my opinion   as someone who can not be mean to pixel and want cool npc to have a good time   there be instance where I be punish for dump it   and while I be ok with consequence to playstyle choice I be not ok with be present no alternative    towards the ending of act    you have soar uplift music   beautiful cinematic shot sync with the music and a vibrant call to arm   contrast that to the shallowness of how thing be tie up in act    and especially to how there be no epilogue to many of your companion   it be baffle that the ending do not care for most of the work you do in the game   choose to give either    meager line or scene for some companion and legitimately nothing for other   also   there be no epilogue or even mention of any of the many side character you meet and fall in love with during the game   as someone who couldn t care less about have a generic   save the city   be a hero   end    motivation   and having be invest in my companion s story   I feel this ending be just not for I and how I like to play   many bug   especially in act     I like to number crunch   I find myself doubt just how accurate the combat log be   double checking effect and wonder if some item    ability truly work the way the game say they do   and that suck a bit when you re try to squeeze efficiency out of your play   also some npc and even companion can bug out   lock you out of dialogue when discuss current event   I do not think this be bad enough to lock you out of content   but sometimes it s jarring to have companion just spazz out when dope       happen    I think any dnd player will enjoy it   and many dungeon master will find thing to steal from the encounter design in this game   the devs have do an amazing job at keep combat fun and exciting and they have find way to spice thing up so many time I be truly impressed   a handful of encounter be more frustrating than fun   but the vast majority of they be fun   and the capstone    end of big quest fight be all memorable for I    you also have way to plug the naturally occur weakness inherent in any playstyle   so you can play your way without feeling punish   while some villain receive more love than other   I believe all of they be sufficiently flesh out   at least thematically   besides the villain   lot of quest be memorable as all and I truly believe there be something for everyone in this game   there be also fantastic foreshadowing do via book and journal and rumor   and this can facilitate a lot of fun in try to understand the plot before the naturally occurring reveal happen   it feel fantastic when a reveal happen and you re like   I know it      because you pay attention to the detail the game be be throw at you    all the way up to the end   there be a natural escalation of the plot that be do well across the act   and that make it so it s easy to remain invest in the story    play it   savor it   but temper expectation and maybe don t rush act    and     maybe by the time you get to act    it and the ending will get the attention and love they deserve and your adventure will have a high chance of conclude in a satisfying way   but the start and the middle imo be fantastic   and there be many awesome thing to be find in act     the hype around the game be mostly legitimate   and just a tiny bit overblown   but it be still deserve    and larian should be praise for what they accomplish    this review suck to give but I feel not enough people rip on the game for the             of act     while the game be good   it teach you thing in act    and    that do not carry over in the end   learn behaviour   check camp   talk to companion   trusting quest or resolution   just fall apart in act     you will find yourself in inexplicable situation that happen not from any sense of storytelling but simply because it s either poorly think out by the devs or some bug lead you here    it be a pity   act    be great and act    be fantastic   there be jank

d hold off on buy for now and wait for the inevitable patch and finished story    dialog    quest to be add   as it s disappointing to spend so much time work up to such a weak final act', 'so I owe

about bg   itself   not involve politic   social acceptance unacceptance and social norm   etc   so if you be interested in that type of review that doesn t include all that stuff   keep read    negative if you be look for instant gratification   you win t get it   actually you may not even want to read the rest of this review because it be long and detailed as this game truly deserve it    some bug exist particularly later in the game   you may notice slow dialogue   or scene that just appear to stop or have awkward pause in they   it be not unexpected with a game of this scope   with that being say   do yourself a favor and actually read the patch note   they be actively be work on and fix   I myself come across a few particular bug on I think it be august   th or   th and quite literally in the august   th hotfix the bug I come across be fix    there be some quest that appear to be break or contain some misinformation   they be not quest or win t result in full on block to the story but they be noticeable   most of the time they appear to sort themselves out but can potentially confuse a player   my suggestion be to use the report feature but don t let it stop you from continue forward    dice roll   honestly there be time where I feel like the dice be weight against the player   I mean      chance of success on an attack and you get a critical miss   which mean you roll a nat     when that single attack would have end the encounter if it hit   but now the enemy get one more turn and manage to take out    of your good teammate   huh    skill check   there seem to be a lot of skill check that you can outright fail and then have no way of know what it be you miss and no way to go on and discover it   this may upset some people as they can not get the satisfaction of know what be there   only know that something be there since it be clearly a fail check    no true guidance    take this as a negative if you will   I be post it here because often time people be always look for guidance for something   this game do not hold your hand   it provide you with objective and mark spot on the map for you   it be up to you to decide when you will do it   how you will do it or even if you will do it   with that being say it be certainly possible to lock yourself out of other quest and encounter or part of the game entirely because of decision you make    to my fellow dark urge player   you understand     clunky    there be part of the game that seem to be incredibly sluggish at time   especially if play for long session   I imagine this be be actively work on but really only start show itself in like the middle to later part of act     I have make report about it myself   but for you performance lover out there   you may see some performance dip especially later in the game or during long play session    steam deck performance    performance on the steam deck be good   however the control seem to be a little bit clunky   the game run fine but the control require some getting use to especially if you be like I and play actively on both the steam deck and the pc    bg   be an excellent game that even with      hour I still have so much more to do   this game be a product   you pay your money and you get a experience   no battle pass   season pass   yearly pass   whatever pass   no content lock behind a pay wall   nothing   just a genuine full and complete game like back in the old day when I start game almost      year ago    the amount of work that be put into this game be       apparent   the sheer amount of detail that the developer take into consideration when make this game be astonishing   I can t begin to say how many time I have do something out of the box and the game   anticipate   it   the atmosphere in this game truly exhibit a notion of   this be your character   you do what it be you want    and the game act accordingly   it be not the reverse where you act accord to the game    there be something to be say about the attention to detail that the developer put into baldur s gate     you can tell it be a labor of love and dedication to a project   not just some new title that need to be release to satisfy a deadline and bring income   the development team truly love create this and love continue work on this project   just look at the hotfixe   you can see it if you step back and just think about what must have go into create this masterpiece    the mechanic and gameplay itself be excellent   it isn t   hand   to you   especially in the later act   you need to think   you need to utilize your brain and take into account all that be go on   who you be up against   etc   etc   you need to author your story   the satisfaction one get from complete a difficult fight be next level   there be one particular battle that involve a particular soundtrack   that I know will stay with I forever   and that say a lot    move to the next point   the soundtrack of this game   it be another masterpiece within a masterpiece   the atmospheric scene create with the sound   the battle music   it be all next level and truly be something so underrated   there have be a number of time where I just stop   just to listen to the music   even side mission like with a particular bard in a particular grove have an entire cinematic scene dedicate to the music and it be just awe inspire   just stop for a moment and think just how much go into make that one scene   that be the type of love and dedication that the studio put into this game and you just don t often see that anymore    the world feel alive   you go into a grove   or you go into a town   and it be bustle with npc carry on their routine   have an argument   fight   training   and be have this conversation    just step back an appreciate that and think about how much effort be make for the game to adjust itself to one of the ton of different way you could have do accomplished fail something    combat    combat also be reward   there be so many different option   use your environment   perhaps you pick up some barrel from the tutorial zone and have be hold onto they since the beginning of the game and decide you want to toss they into the battlefield and detonate they   or maybe you been lug around some barrel of alcohol that you now want to utilize on the field   go for it   maybe you bit off more than you can chew and need to make a tactical retreat   combat be so dynamic   there be no   set way   to do something   your option be numerous   maybe you do want to just truck through everyone and don t want to think tactically   sure go right ahead   the mechanic themselves be intricate   with the different damage type   resistance   buff   debuff   etc   all within the nature of dungeon and dragon    the story    it be yours to craft and how you get to the end be up to you   it be detailed   it be interesting   it have its twist and turn that will make you say   no way     be you serious     I know it    and the list go on and on but you be the one who create the story    if you be look for a full and complete game with wonderful music   a studio that care about their community base and product   great mechanic and an outstanding story that you create with your decision and you can look past some minor over sight in a game of this magnitude and slight performance issue that be actively be work on then baldur s gate    be for you and you will get your money s worth   with or without any dnd experience', 'I will preface this review with state that I admit that I be a larian fan boy   so far swen and crew haven t let I down   I own copy of their game across multiple platform include the switch   and other storefront   divinity original sin    be my favorite game of all time   so with that disclosure in mind I will make a quick review    I have like many play bg   and bg   for countless hour over the year include the beamdog enhance edition across multiple platform and it be another game series that be dear to my heart    I have also have tabletop campaign set in faerun so I be fond of keep close to the rule set as possible which be hard   recently I get back into prepare to dm some   e campaign so I know at least   e be easy to adapt in many way than      be    anyway as I mention I love the divinity engine and feel it work great here   sure there be no way to make a perfect video game to replicate the tabletop experience or to get the rule set perfect but larian have do as good of job as I think as possible    I can t wait to get a barb or sorc to throw into my party but the current selection be good and well round   while I have a few optimization issue I be play on one of my low end rig and didn t try on a well machine   even then it be a slight stutter and nothing game break    while I only put a couple hour in so far as I don t want to over play the first act yet I have to say that larian may have write a game that will eventually unseat do   as my number    game of all time once they be finish    if you be a fan of baldur s gate   divinity   or larian your money be well invest in the game   I know it s a steep price for an early access title but having be a backer on a number of larian project so far they have always deliver as promise', 'good game of the decade so far', 'I play a bit of early access a year ago or so   so when I start play this game in full release   I already know it be go to be pretty good   but the full release be far well than my own expectation   this already be most likely one of my favourite game and I have yet to explore other possibility ingame    the finale of every act feel so rewarding after all your effort   the detail in every zone be amazing   I find myself explore every single room and corner of the world and collect book   note and other paper full of lore    my favourite act be definitely act iii but not to say act I and ii be bad   it be because of the previous act that act iii make sense and feel so satisfy    my favourite arc   if you can call it that   be house of hope or raphael s arc   I m sure most of the player agree they enjoy his song during his   boss fight    this poetic devil name raphael be one my favourite character   I think he and mizora truly represent what we know of devil    nice detail on     hp    hope be also cool   wholesome and funny   how be I not go to save she during my evil run      my favourite companion be predictable I know   but yes shadowheart and I be not talk about romance   only    every character really develop during the story and try to solve their own personal problem while fight together to solve their common problem   the illithid tadpole stick in their brain and save the world from the absolute   or not depend on your choice    most character   even npc   have a story   a personality   a opinion of their own   so sometimes   if you be make certain decision   you might not just be affect the main or secondary character but also a   random   npc walk by    cinematic be amazing and well plan   I use screenshot a lot   I hope the voice actor of this game be pay good   the character feel so real with their emotion and personality   the team who work on expression and body language help a lot to give the character life of course    a few extra I feel the need to say   shadow isle be the hard part imo   it do indeed feel how hard it be to live in those condition and the amount of destruction in the various place of the map cause by the curse   but again all that to satisfyingly reward we with a lot   karlach s end make I want to cry no matter the ending you choose   cry from sadness   relief or joy   I m not sure if I miss stuff in the previous act   but act iii feel the long one   it be probably intend    I think that s all   thank for reading and for the patience   sorry if bad english   ', 'it s not flawless   but there s a strong argument to be make for this be the great crpg of all time   this really feel like what dragon age could should have be if it have move more in the crpg direction rather than opt to play it safe by become high fantasy mass effect', 'I will preface this by say I fall in love with dungeon and dragon over a decade ago so I be slightly biased   but even so baldur s gate    be a love letter to the setting and to rpg s    it s be year since I ve see a game go so indepth with not only the setting   but character   dialogue and option   right out of the gate you be show that the environment can be use to your advantage to help in a fight   without it ever feel force   no oddly place explode barrel here   when explosive barrel be present it feel natural   when they re not their   in their place be rock that can be drop   water that can be freeze   mud that can slow   intricate care and attention to detail have make the visual story tell compelling and the environment feel real    if you be not familiar with the setting it would be very hard to tell that lairon didn t design faerun   with lore straight out of the source book for the dungeon and dragon setting   carefully weave into a narrative all of their own   it do so much justice to the forget realm    you would think this would be an alienate experience for newcomer to the realm   but instead extra effort have be take with a narrator who will   on succesful skill check or relevant backstory point   explain in a way newcomer to dungeon and dragon can understand   for example when first encounter a god   they will be name and their domain explain   this never feels force or overly wordy   it be a sentence here and there that succinctly explain without patronise or overwhelming    I ve be play baldur s gate    since it be first available in pre release and complete everything I could on my first character   when the patch mean I could no long play the save with the new content   though with each patch the option to stay on that patch to continue your save have be give   I ve remade my character and dive back in    I be still find new thing   new content or new sidequest   new option   if you explore carefully it feel like their be always something to find    if you have be miss the rpg s of old where it feel like you be play in narratively rich world with deep character   look no far    as we be still in early access there be some jank don t get I wrong   at present there be no difficulty option so what be there be what you get   but see how much progress have be make and how often we be update and how much feedback lairon be take onboard be awe inspire    I would rarely sink       into a game   but despite the jank at times baldur s gate be wholeheartedly worth every penny', 'if you want to play d d but you do not have any friend   you should buy this game', 'a scene of a vampire have sex with a druid that shape shift into bear shoot this game up     place in the top selling list   glad to be a part of this community        ', 'you

definitely some issue   and I ll get those out of the way first       if you re not use to the dice and turn base combat system   you re go to find yourself reload    a lot   hell   you re probably go to be reload a lot even if you be a master at game like divinity   they even use dice roll for dialogue scenario    which might need a little more tuning in my opinion   it can be frustrating when you fail the desire outcome because you roll a    on a persuasion check    even though persuasion be one of your strength   I suppose this frequent chance of failure can be appeal to some   if you re the kind of player who enjoys roll with the consequence or outcome   I however   be very bother by it sometimes   if I do not want to blow someone to bit   then a fail skill check rarely change my decision   I just reload until I succeed at make the choice that I want to make   so if this sound like you   make sure you save often   and in different slot       I be quite disappointed with the companion   I ll try and explain this without spoil   yes   some of they look great   be well act out and useful in combat   but other than that    they suck   all of they   keep in mind   this be come from a heterosexual female player with her own taste and opinion   I have no vested interest in my female companion romantically   but even if I do   they d probably still annoy the hell out of I   not interested in the bipolar moody little half elf   princess    then how about the gith woman   nope    she s get one hell of an annoying superiority complex   just want to kill or belittle anyone who isn t gith   but she do have some rather sweet armor    at least I get some satisfaction out of kill she and loot it off her corpse   take that   b tch   next up you have the mage    a legit good companion who doesn t hate your gut every time you re nice to a helpless villager   I can t say why he be a hard no   without spoiler   so just no   and hell no   it wouldn t even be tactically smart to keep he around after a certain point   I feel like I get major troll by larian with this companion   next   how about the bland wannabe hero who only like you so long as you re diving face first into combat in every scenario   just another village idiot   I often forget to speak to he at my camp   he s just that forgettable and uninteresting as a companion character   but wait lady    we have this beguiling elven vampire guy   how sexy be that    oh nevermind   he s just a prissy little hedonist who whine about everything and be just as much a selfish prick as the elf princess and the gith   and he s not much to look at in truth   that terrible attempt at a lady slayer hairdo need to go   so   if you think you re go to get to just mosey around help folk   make the realm a well place   and overall be a good and honorable hero   whilst still win over at least a couple of your companion   think again   they re prick   and they win t be happy with you unless you re a prick to everyone you meet   the companion need some work   and I do hope they add a few more    cough   haslin please     cough     the crappy companion aren t a deal breaker for I though because there be so many interesting and detailed encounter with npc throughout the game   it do help make up for it       I hope the loot system get a little more attention as well   one of the thing I always look forward to in these kind of game be the customization aspect   the satisfaction of find something both useful and unique to put on that look great   there be practically none of that   yeah you get some high end weapon and jewelry but you re pretty much stuck with the same armor look for each armor type   you can equip companion armor   but that s not exactly a solution to generic and limited choice    these be my only large issue with the game   there be some bug and glitch and the occasional crash   but I be expect much bad on that front base on what other have say   quest be quite interesting and exploration can actually be time consume yet enjoyable   combat be challenge yet fun   I especially enjoy push enemy over the edge of drop off or drop light brazier on their head    the environment and character detail be gorgeous   I m big into character creation and feel it could use a little more variety in bg   with thing like hair style   makeup   and face option but if they decide not to add more   it s still satisfactory   especially when you consider how much detail and work must have go into create each unique face   hairstyle   eye color   etc    all in all this game be well on its way to greatness   if you intend to really take your time sample the different class and choice and what the game will have to offer in the near future   I definitely recommend buy it now   and make sure to give feedback to the devs   they re listen   but if you d rather enjoy a smooth first experience and dive straight into the main story   you d well wait for the full release     update   my god it s as if the devs read through my entire review   post launch the companion be more likable or in one or two case just somewhat easy to please   and so much polish have go into the game   feel very different from early access and yet it s still very much the same game   larian continue to impress   my only linger complaint be   why can t my female character have big boob   seriously be it consider offensive for a woman to have full jug or something   what be this new cultural gaming norm in the west where the chick all have little tiddie in character creator   be we baby some ultra feminist insecurity or something   well I m a woman   I m a straight woman   and I like big jug   gimmie my jug back   maybe there will be a decent mod for it soon', 'I truly want to love this game   and judge by the overwhelming positive feedback from the community   I believe that most people do too   I have try to be patient with larian   because they seem to have a deep respect and high opinion of both the setting and the player themselves   but   I can not recommend it in its current state    at the time of write this review   I have power through an incredible amount issue   especially for a game with this level of critical acclaim   to get to act    on the hard difficulty   simply put   I believe that this will be great in     month if the developer spend their time wisely    not only fix the rest of the bug   but address the devastating and crippling performance issue    to provide some detail   here be a snippet of what I have experience   I don t have the good pc in the world   but it relatively high end   as a benchmark   I can run most of the late game in   k ultra with high fps       an average of a crash every    hour of gameplay   which mean I have see around    dozen crash   yes   I have try troubleshoot with everything that larian and the community have suggest    with no luck     combat will pause no discernible reason   your attack will be delay by        second   an npc will do nothing while the model gyrate in position     in act     the part of the game that you have be look forward to the most    the performance be    the game will completely freeze up for    solid minute   fps will drop a fraction of the previous average   npc walk around aimlessly in circle   etc     yes   there        second load screen and the game be     gb   but honestly that feel like nothing compare to the other issue   but   the bad part be the   a death by a thousand cut   core gameplay experience   the game just feel tedious   a few example     your companion refuse to follow you correctly and you have to switch to each one individually just to get they to jump over a   m ravine     double clicking on companion portrait to switch control work      of the time     you try to select an enemy twice in a row   but because the miss animation wasn t do   your character shoot the ground     the camera   oh my god the camera   do battle inside of building   with multiple floor especially   be incredibly frustrating    the core of bg   be a phenomenal   ground break   and deep rpg experience   there be simply a unprecedented amount of freedom to control both the narrative and your gameplay   but   at least for I   it be almost completely ruin by performance and quality of life issue   however   I look forward to see the state of the game in the come year and revisit my review', 'baldur s gate    have a ton of potential   I ve manage to put roughly     hour into what be only      of the base game   bug aside    which there be a few    this should be a perfect title for individual who be both crpg veteran or look for a new genre to play   it look good   everything be voice and the combat be straight forward base on a paper and pen rpg system    this be early access however and you should only buy now if you intend to either support the developer or think you d be adequately satisfied by a buggy incomplete game   if you be look for a complete   well rounded game you can dump       hour in   then wait until this go full release', 'I wish I could post a mixed review   it may seem strange to post a negative review after play over     h   but act    kill all my enthusiasm    I like larian s gameplay in general   act    and    be awesome   interaction with companion be great    act    be another game   a tedious sandbox game with no overall structure   none of my action have consequence   all quest be completely separate   it feel like there be a ton of cut content   where be the upper city     companion interaction in act    be still bug for the majority   the final fight be the most boring       I ve ever be through    the game should have end with act     I would give it a       if it be the case', 'wait for release or not wait for release   this game be absolutely fantastic   yes there be bug and glitch during this early access period   but this will only get well   great voice act   great exploration   interactivity   arguably endless possibility of experimentation   you can play however you want   and that mean high replayability   you can also enjoy it with friend for a dnd night

make I fall in love with turn base rpgs        hour of pure pleasure and I think I ll be back   ', 'I usually shun major aaa game in favor of small indie publisher   so when this game first come out and get a lot of attention   I ignore it   think it be overrate   eventually   my curiosity get the good of I and I decide to give baldur s gate    a try   boy   have I be miss out    game play and game mechanic be similar to dungeon    dragon   there be nice tie in to the series that d d player   include myself   will appreciate   such as certain race like elf and half elve have dark vision   critical success and critical failure   and class like bard   wizard   and fighter   one key difference between the game and d d be that in baldur s gate     instead of roll initiative at the start of each turn   initiative be roll only once and remain lock in for the rest of combat   it s not a feature but the most authentic part to d d be perception check   just like d d your character will fail almost all of their perception check   this be true even if they have high wisdom   which affect perception    and even if the switch or button or trap be an inch from their face   knowledge of d d isn t require to play though   as there be tutorial for your first play through and game play be intuitive    where the game really shine be all of its content   there be so many class   paladin   barbarian   fighter   druid   cleric   bard   and monk   and just as many race too   many class and race also have sub class or sub race   which allow in depth customization of your character   the only problem with this be customize your first character   assume you don t choose a pre make one   can take a very long time   especially if you re indecisive like I   my first character daeli   be a wild magic sorcerer   and I have a cleric   fighter   and rogue in my party   each class feel distinct and be fun in their own way    the story be very enjoyable   no spoiler here     you be force to make many tough irreversible decision with far reach consequence throughout   this do raise my blood pressure at time but it also make everything feel more consequential   I like how my party member   backstorie diverge and intersect with the main story   each character be well write and fully flesh out   which make it feel like a real d d campaign   there isn t much replayability when it come to the main story   you can make different decision   which can affect the ending but the overall story line remain the same   unlike d d there be only one campaign   thing that surprise you in your first play through will be expect in the second   replayability be instead find in game play and quest   it s impossible to complete every quest   especially every party member s unique quest   in one play through   all the different race and class also give the game more replay value   you can also recruit different party member than last time   result in new character interaction    my only complaint be save in the game   there be an auto save system   but it only activate after you enter important area   you re force to manually quick save most of the time   I eventually get the hang of it   but it be annoying at first when I forget to quick save and lose progress   I play on the balanced difficulty   which be essentially normal   and struggle during many fight   I have to reload old save because my party keep die or fail   that s more of a skill issue on my party than a problem with the game though   if you play a lot of casual game and don t have experience with rpgs   I d recommend the narrative or easy mode   thing will still be challenge   it s just your blood pressure win t spike as much    overall   this be a good game for anyone who like d d or story rich rpgs

intention to revise my review if the game improve upon release    well   release be hear and I be pleased to say that I be blow away by how much the game have evolve during that time   the story be much more developed   the character be rich   and the immersion be deep and strongly feel   the antagonistic feature that I complain strongly about in my initial review have be mediate by a lot of extra dialog option   which make the character far less grating   in addition   different game mode have alleviate the problem of   sadistic dm syndrome   in which the game be ridiculously hard to survive   by allow easy   medium   and hard level of play    I m only a few hour into a fresh play   but I be strongly hook into this game despite having play it before   it s clear the developer pour their heart and soul into this game   I can t wait to discover as many little thing as I can   there be so much attention pay to dialog and make the world as immersive and interactive as possible     it s really a marvel how a scripted game can feel as responsive to your behavior as this game do    while the criticism that this isn t true pen and paper d d still hold   and you ll feel like the dice don t always roll along the percentile that the game tell you they should   I don t think that s as big a problem now as I do early   bg   still feel like d d even if it s not a       faithful reproduction of the rule   and let s be fair   a digital version of pen and paper rule might not be that fun   they re two different medium     so I be pleased to change my review from thumb down to thumb up   and I hope you ll give bg   a try now that it s fully develop     my original negative review be preserve below since I receive some award for it   and I figure it might be worth see what I be initially dissatisfied with compare to how it have change               I wouldn t recommend this game just yet    there s a lot to like about it   but there s also a lot of frustrating thing   janky cutscene   bad ai   and if you re a d d player look for a digital version of d d   you ll probably be frustrate by the monster that be far strong than they be in d d rule   who nearly always hit   and who seem to deal double digit damage with every hit while your fighter miss repeatedly on a      success chance   it s d d where every minor scuffle be a fight to the very death    having play for a while after write my first review   I ve figure out that my dissatisfaction with bg   boil down to two main issue       inconsistent adherence to d d rule this be a contentious one because a pure conversion of a tabletop rpg to the computer still wouldn t feel the same as play around the tabletop   but they ve change enough of the rule   in very confusing way   that will infuriate any tabletop player who be look to this game for a   digital d d experience    spell and power have the same name   but they don t work the same way you re use to   bizarre rule make your percentage to hit vary depend on height   angle   and other thing that just don t factor into d d rule   creature be far   far strong than they should be   and character class be debuffe in strange way that don t follow d d rule   you ll notice that your fighter will frequently miss   x in a row even with a      chance to hit   and your rogue whose sneak attack should deal   d    d     damage will often roll    s and    s for damage     something that should be numerically impossible   but the game non d d   d d   mechanic allow for it   it may be cool as a forget realm game   but as a d d game it be very unsatisfying       sadistic storytelle numerical cheating aside   the writer of this game seem to really hate the player   almost every d d player have at some point play in a group with a terrible dm   a dm who insert their own hyper strong mary sue npc into the party to do thing the player can t do     a dm who punish the player when they don t do thing the way they want     a dm who make every shopkeeper and town guard into an openly hostile assassin who want nothing more than to murder the player     a dm for whom there be only two option for gameplay   kill or be kill    bg   feel like play with such a sadistic dm   everything in this game want to kill you or die   none of the monster or creature you encounter act logically   they just attack you   and they be always ready to fight   a goblin could be on the toilet read a newspaper but if you drop a needle down the hallway he will fire an acid bomb tip arrow at you that very second   it s sadistic    bad of all   the main npc who be suppose to be your friend be all            every one of they at some point will either try to murder you for no apparent reason   and then play all friendly the next moment   would you party up and sleep next to a vampire who literally try to murder you moment ago   how about a priestess of an evil god who try to slit your throat while you be asleep in bed   those be some of the thing that bg   expect you to be perfectly ok with   it s just like that sadistic dm who demand you accept his obnoxious edgelord npc as your party leader    it s clear that the developer put a lot of love into the game   the minuscule detail of the world   the tiny easter egg that you can find all over the place   the beauty of the location     these speak to such great care in create and design this piece   but then they layer that with toxic character and antagonistic story piece that take all of that goodness away    maybe it will get well before the final release   or maybe the game will be save by mod   but right now the core philosophy behind bg   feel like it s head in the wrong direction', 'bg   be one of those genre defining game that come along every console cycle   with a rich story

to shrink in subsequent act   they do not lack for content   my only complaint   if you can call it that   be that larian isn t make a follow up or release any dlc   crpgs may not be for everyone

 so what I can tell you after play through act   over    time with break for every    patch be that what I ve see of it be go in a good direction not only with major change like new class or mechanic but also subtle little touch that game do not need but   in my opinion   benefit from    change narrator s intonation and some cutscene to even more fitting for particular situation   etc     no solid idea where the main story be go yet but look great so far   gameplay be very pleasant   combat easy to understand even if you be unfamilair witn dnd e   very close   with just a few change    frankly I find act   of this game more enterntainining than some whole   finish rpgs   there be a lot to explore   find and miss out on in result of some decision in term of quest   loot   npc   lore and probably something I just forget    so yeah   its already one of my favourite rpgs   and yet I would not recommend it to the impatient   it seem the official release be go to happen soon rather than later but larian seem like a studio that would rather take it s time with a game than rush to meet previous promise   at the time I m write this release be only hint at happen sometime       but there be no official one   break between patch usually take a few month   so if you have doubt   just keep your money for now   if you trust opinion of stranger on the internet and want that   from my basic

turn base and if you don t want to play an ea uncompleted game then don t spend     dollar   if it be on discount during ea it would incentivize people to buy that would otherwise not want to play the ea version of game    warn     people can t take joke   larian can be tongue and cheek   they be not malicious   cancel culture be the thing that be malicious       this be not divinity     the ambiance atmosphere feel more in line with knight of the old republic and dragon age   origin   it remind I of old bioware quite a bit   the gameplay and how one handle it be also quite different   I use consumable a lot more for instance   which impact how I loot   how I look at starting fight   etc   the mechanic be different with   e rule    more interaction with environment   break statue   stalagmite   burn webs   knock people off edge   vertical gameplay matter more   etc    there be some thing that do remind I of divinity but it be more surface thing like accidentally put a chest in my inventory   similar key binding   etc       ish hour in divinity original sin         permutation   there be ton of variability   besides be multiple approach to problem there be different arrangement step can be take   not everyone will experience the depth of this though   I m completely early access for the third time   a single play through can take        hour        it be not isolate from baldur s gate   this story be aware of the setting   and take place after the descent to avernus   lot of foreshadow for what be to come and I m excited to see how larian handle the setup       character   some people thing they be lack   but I don t think so   you be a party put together due to circumstance   it take time for people to open up   I actually like this approach because it be similar to how a lot of dnd campaign can go with a variety of character that be put together when they otherwise wouldn t interact with one another   furthermore   there be ton of character outside the playable one and lot of dialogue   lot of people will miss out on this though   I encourage you to talk to the goblin and see what be in the game   don t just murder hobo it or you will miss out       I have not encounter any   gamebreake   bug   the bad bug be probably a visual bug that force I to load to solve a puzzle   my game as crash about    time so about once per     hour of gameplay for I   clip lip sync bug exist   still well than bethesda game lol   ', 'august can t get here fast enough', 'negative first   it s early access so it have the expect bug   none of those bug be game breaking and multiplayer run pretty smoothly as long as all the player involve have decent ping   when it doesn t run smoothly   it s easy to enough to reload and get the game roll again    since those be the only negative   I highly recommend this game even in an early access state   it s beautiful   the combat and story be interesting and engage   and it have a lot of replayability with all the different build you can create with the available class   when the game be fully release with additional race   class   and the rest of the act   currently only act    available   it s go to easily be in my top    favorite rpg s   top    simply because it have co op   which in my opinion   there be never enough of   it have similarity to the divinity original sin franchise   but enough of it be different and submerge in the forget realm that it doesn t feel like a clone   except for the beach   why be there always a wreck at a beach   xd    ', 'play your way    don t use a guide

come close to the depth   width   and care put into this game with a last of its kind aaa dev which have sense move on from the series for good reason   in a modern landscape where company buy out studio just to lay off the people who put they on the map   in favor of contract hire they can cycle out and pay the bare minimum   this studio stand above the wreckage of modern aaa game and stand tall with broad shoulder   proud to be the good and humble enough to continue support and even release the dev tool so the game can be love and cherish for many many year to come   in short this be the current great game of all time and be more than worth your money I highly recommend buy the deluxe edition simply to support the devs   not to say the additional reward aren t worth it either   but if that s not enough to convince you go ahead and pirate it   you will come to love the game and want to support the devs anyway', 'I roll a perception check to have hot lesbian sex']\n"
