it start with one one thing I don t know why it doesn t even matter how hard you try keep that in mind   I design this rhyme to explain in due time   all I know time be a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swing watch it count down to the end of the day the clock tick life away
goat   if you be an old gamer   you know that countless video game have be inspire by this game   get from the game shooting system   to puzzle base on physics and science   storyline and many other thing   half life    be a great revolution in video game and make the game industry move forward several year   twenty year later   it be still not only playable   but well than many of the current game   a clear example of art have no expiration date   with respect to the game that can be say to be the only game that deserve a score of     out of

what more can be say about half life     arguably one of the great single player game in existence   be it as an fps or otherwise   I first play this game back in        upon its release   I find it odd and slightly annoying that I have to install this   steam game launcher   program that come along with it   never could have realise what a mammoth this would eventually become    I have be anticipate this game for several year since complete the original half life   one of the great game in its own right   and one which have inspire countless other and move the gaming industry forward    half life    be able to do this yet again   this time by introduce the source engine   up until that point   nothing like it have ever be see in game   the physics system be revolutionary   valve   brilliantly   introduce the gravity gun to fully showcase and take advantage of this engine   and to create unique and fantastic level design   the like of which be still impressive to this day   the story start off several year after the event at black mesa   as gordon freeman arrive via train to city      the visual   the audio   and the voice act be all integral to the story s presentation   and allow I to experience a level of immersion that I have seldom be able to experience since   the character we meet feel alive with distinct facial animation   and the game transition seamlessly through gordon s first person view   thank to the source engine   the lighting and use of it be exceptional   water effect and sunlight have never look so good up until this point    there be so much more that can be say about this game   half life    be a masterpiece and should be include in every pc gamer s library

blimey      year ago I have I first go at half life    on I brother s computer when I be just a nipper of      I still remember those top notch feeling   gordon freeman s a real legend   he be   the street of city     be right in I heart   alyx   she s the good mate you could ask for   cheer   valve
half life    be release in       be consider by many one of if not the great action game of all time   I have never play a half life game before   except for garry s mod but that s only the asset really    and have only hear what everyone always say about the game   at the end of the day   I decide to pick up half life     unsure if it would truly grant I any joy   this decision end up take up the majority of the next two day as half life    become one of my favorite game   I don t have anything I can complain about here   the game be old but still work well and even well than some of the new game   so instead   I ll go over some of the thing that addict I    half life    be story drive and connect to the story of its predecessor   half life   however you don t have to know anything about the first game or about the franchise at all to be draw into the vast world and the conflict between the rebel and the combine   the game do a great job of tell the story through environmental storytelling   and you realise soon after get off the train that these people be not there to help you   admittedly the story be a little slow on the uptake   but around the time you reach nova prospect   it really pick up pace and get go   it fully immerse you in it and never lets go until the credit roll   you meet many different character that all share a nice humour   this be great   because it make you laugh   this may sound obvious but it s a thing some modern game can t quite achieve anymore   what I be try to say   the joke be funny   half life s humour be great    even after     year   the gun and the general action still feel great   I have find great joy in fire the gun or use the physics to my advantage   because it all feel so perfect   they nail the sound and feel of the gun   besides that   I also like that it s not just simply about shoot the enemy   you have to keep track of your ammo and decide which weapon to use in what scenario   the weapon progression also come at a great pace   grant you new and more powerful weapon every few chapter   you can even miss some which lead I to the next thing I want to praise    the map design   half life    combine great   atmospheric map with clever gameplay integration   thank to the source engine s physics you can interact with almost anything and use it to your advantage   it s not a corridor shooter and I love that   you can almost every time choose your own approach   in the more open segment of the map   you be incite to explore it to find more ammo   power   or new weapon   all this combine lead to half life    s great map    lastly   I want to praise half life    s atmosphere   while this game do have a dedicated soundtrack   it only play on rare occasion   which be great   combine with the ambient sound   this lead to you feel like you re actually in a post apocalyptic world   and there s no other soul in sight   just you and the world   this be a genius move and I love it   this also help create the so call   kenopsia   feeling which I m sure you re familiar with if you re into source game    half life    be   even after     year just what everyone always say it be   it s a masterpiece   and for a fair price too   you can   without shame get half life    even off sale   I promise you   you will not regret it    final score       
for many people   you either remember play this game when it come out or your parent old sibling play this around the mid       s   my case be the latter   as I be a toddler   so I be unable to appreciate gordon freeman save the world unfortunately   while I wasn t old enough to get the authentic half life    experience   it be one of the first pc game I do play back in late        largely because I be limited to my parent old work pc   I make do with what I could and know   didn t even have a steam account at this time   I remember try to crack this game for free back in the day use a usb flash drive   haha    and while the game itself be fondly remember by many   it do show its age   but out of all the old title I play   be one of the few game that still hold up   while this game nowday isn t special gameplay and mechanic wise   if you consider the time it be release in   it be well think out and attention to detail be sharp   the ai   while have its own moment   like pathfinde be slow at time on some map   be notably impressive   combine soldier do tactical realistic maneuver to try and counter the player for example   while this detail be subtle   it hold up among modern game   plot wise   while not unique in of itself   for its execution and theme it portray   it do a good job of do so   the concept of an ultra orwellian regime like the combine picture here be immersive and make engage with feel rewarding story progression wise    with all consider   this game have age like wine and be a certify classic among the league of timeless classic
gordon doesn t need to hear all this   he s a highly train professional
great game oat imo   extremely ahead of its time   the mechanic the physics the graphic the storyline damn valve couldn t ever make anything well than this

I miss the old valve   the half life gold valve    the new game every year valve   straight from the soul valve    I hate the new valve   the fat with cash valve    the always silent valve   the no hl   news valve    
  half life    be like a long await meeting with a friend who always bring with he a lot of problem and a few mutant   you start the game with the fact that you be literally throw into a world where every second person have their own version of   stalker   and they all want to kill you   what for   I don t know   but it seem to be their hobby   graphic   she s so good that I start to suspect that my old video game be just jealous   every time I see physics in a game   it feel like I m look at magic    oh   look   I can throw a crate at a zombie s head   this be scientific progress    what about gordon freeman   this guy be a real hero   he be silent as if he have a secret contract with lipstick manufacturer    don t say a word   just look mysterious    I would also be silent if I be constantly surround by alien and soldier who clearly do not read the label   do not touch     and   of course   who can forget about the famous airship   it s like if you decide to have a picnic on the roof   but instead of food you only have bomb and a couple of zombie    hey guy   who have spare bun    in general    half life     be a game that make you laugh and cry at the same time   if you want to spend time with your good friend   possibly dead    experience the force of physics and realize that life can be even strange than your morning hair   then this game be for you    p s   don t forget   if you see a giant ant   run   just run         half life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        half life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        p s                                                                          
finally finish this game in        the graphic be age a bit but the game play still feel really good   very fun gameplay   to the point where I can just mess around in the game and never actually complete the game because the mechanic be so good   there be a rtx mod that be come out that should improve the way the game look very soon    the story and the way you move about in the world   I love how everything you see you can pretty much can go to   the gravity gun be very cool   basically pick up anything on the ground and use it as a weapon    I couldn t imagine play this game when it be release in        there be a huge cliff hanger at the end   and then episode    continue exactly where this game stop at    if you play this game   make sure to understand that the story be just start in half life     and you be require to play the episode to keep go in the story   but I love every minute of the game while play it    this be easily one of the good pc game   if you be a pc gamer you well play this    do not skip on half life alyx either   
an absolute classic that deserve to be play by everyone   of course   some part of it didn t age too well   but it be overall a fun experience and even feature a couple of nice physics base puzzle   they have some great idea back in the day      achievement require time         hour difficulty   in my opinion      out of      the achievement list of this game be great   you need to play through the game on any difficulty you want and get all the collectible lambda cache   there be also some nice combat relate trophy   nothing too hard and quite fun   since it s a fast        it doesn t overstay its welcome    all that remain be one final question   where hl    o o
I like to think this be the good game ever   still be   everything we know about modern shooter be base on half life     from borderland   dishonor   prey and to the late wolfenstein game and even bioshock infinite
no one need to read a review of hl  
tbh the first half of the game be a pain because it be sooo much driving and have janky as hell physics   but the game really pick up the slack halfway through         
game old than I somehow bring nostalgia   no idea how
 
yes   I believe in valve supremacy
here I will leave the cat   whoever pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up   I need steam point   please   thank you                 l       x                                                          
not as good as half life    to I gameplay wise but definitely still a masterclass in weave storytelle seamlessly into the game without be overly intrusive or take control away from you   as old as the original source engine be   you can t beat the ragdoll or the general feel of half life    s physics system   the general vibe of half life    make you feel isolated much like the first game which work to the game s advantage    I think the gun in    don t feel or sound too great these day   save for a few exception   combine ar     shotgun   magnum   crossbow   but it s not a total deal breaker and the one that do sound incredibly weak aren t to a detrimental level anyway    the dystopian aesthetic mix in with the distinctly design alien of half life give this entry that classic grimy sci fi feel that the series be well know for at this point   a high point for shooter in general I d say
half life    be a brilliant continuation of the first game   enhance everything from the storytelling to the gameplay   the update graphic and physics be a game changer   especially when face enemy watch they react realistically to your action   particularly with the gravity gun   feel amazing   the environment   from the oppressive city     to the terrifying ravenholm   be more immersive and detailed   add to the sense of dread and excitement    if you enjoy the original   this sequel be a must play
half life    be a amazing game by the valve team by a bunch   this game make so much thing iconic like the headcrab and even a crowbar   the voice act be great and this make I love non voice main character because it add to the environment to the game like portal and other game   the enemy be amazing too   like the zombie and the combine and such   I d love if the valve team make a half life    because this game be amazing and a literal gem in gaming

I play the first one way back in the day and only play this one for the first time at the end of        man do it hold up   I haven t have this much fun with too many game on the ps   ps   era   this game be release     year ago and be well than      of the game out since then
what be there leave to say   niche internet micro celebrity already have scour every single pixel   mesh   and mp   of this game   for it be one of the game of all time   a masterpiece maybe   a bundle of fun definitely   and genre redefine unquestionably   but should people still talk about it   yes   because it be a game that exist and be somewhat decent to a degree which be in no doubt not an insult towards it s overbear legacy which have leave ripple in the sphere of entertainment as we recognize it   it s okay
as soon as I step into the shoe of gordon freeman   I be immerse in the detailed and oppressive world of city      where danger feel ever present   the atmosphere be thick with tension   and the game brilliantly blend immersive storytelling with clever gameplay mechanic   from the very start   it capture my attention with its unique mix of action   puzzle   and groundbreake physics    I really appreciate how this classic challenge you at every turn   encourage strategic thinking while keep you deeply engage   it combine exceptional gameplay   an engage story   and innovative mechanic   solidify its place as one of the good game of all time

it be the year       and release of steam   I just skip school to go and buy the game and be underage   cashier wouldn t sell it to I since it be rate      I get my parent to buy the game for I later that day   on my old pc with radeon       I start blast half life     it be like a new generation of gaming at that point   valve really do leap into the future at that point   it take I many hour to realize the potential of physics in the game and I get stick a few time because my tunnel brain back then didn t understand also the gravity gun be the main point of the game at many part   half life    be one of the good fps game ever make and everybody should play it   the whole half life franchise need to be experience and without this game many of our modern fps games wouldn t be the same   gaming history

not really a fan of the half life sequel due to its massive change in the game s world setting   can t say it s a bad game tho   for a       release     year after original half life release   the graphical improvement can truly be feel   can t say that about some of the new aaaa game release that look like they get stick     year in the past   overall feel like a massive upgrade of its predecessor   especially in the story   as it go far beyond escape a science facility
pretty fun and nice to play
it s okay
I be grateful to the heaven for be bear and grow up in a time when I could witness the birth of this legend
maybe if this review get             or       like and    award then valve will consider make half life  
good story mode game I ve ever play   it deserve all the legacy it have since     
this game be nearly     year old   despite its age   this be one of those game that have set a high standard on how modern game should be make   from story tell   game play   and interaction with the environment   most modern game have struggle or give up on tie together these fundamental element and have instead focus on either graphic    politic    or both   the graphic from half life    may not be visually up to par to today s standard   but they nail the fundamental so well that a modern player can look past these old graphic and still enjoy this masterpiece     year later   I typically don t play or recommend mature game   but this one deserve an exception
gordon hit people with     hiiiiis crowbar I like this so wake up   mr   player   wake up and     buy half life  
francium have a half life of     minute
absolute peak
still hold up in       tbh   everyone should play this
its half life    what else be I supose to say   if you like fps game with a story then here you go   also this game be really cheap when its on discount
                   
its a game
perfect resumption to the half life classic
          
I give a negative review to this game s predecessor   so it s only fair that I also give this game my honest opinion now that I have finish it   and it be a very positive one     simply say   this game be fantastic   I genuinely can t think of one chapter I genuinely dislike in this game   and every single one of they distinguish itself in a memorable and unique way   the level design have improve so much   there be rare part where I do get a bit lost but that s because I be blind and didn t see the obvious thing   and the game communicate very well how to solve puzzle   while not give the solution away immediately   something simple like put a few grenade on a table to put the thought of   wait   would throw a grenade work    let s try it out   in the player s head     speak of level design   while I genuinely think hl   be pretty unfair   hl   be the complete opposite   every time I die   I never feel frustrated   and barely even save manually because every automatic checkpoint be well place    no more random death   way too many enemy with too little supply etc etc   the amount of health and ammo the game give you be perfect   it never feel like it give you too much   but you never really feel like you just don t have enough to get past a section   hl   basically fix every problem from the first one on that regard   the lambda cache hide all around be also a great way to get you to explore the environment   and sometimes even solve little puzzle to get to they and be reward with well need supply   it s a cool little break from fight     the gunplay be also so satisfy   every weapon feel pretty great to use   and the only one I find myself not use by the end be the basic pistol   which be normal   and oh my god the gravity gun be such a good idea for an ammoless weapon   if you want to conserve ammo   you can use the environment as your weapon    it enhance the level design so much   as now everything that make up the battlefield   every prop can be use in different way to take down enemy   hell   there s even an achievement for beat a whole chapter with just the gravity gun   it s perfectly doable     one last thing I want to bring up be also the excellent worldbuilding of this game   it s the good example of   show don t tell    the character never tell you what happen to ravenholm   you ve see the piece of the puzzle yourself and you can make up the horrifying picture by yourself   you see for yourself the horror that the combine have create   and you have everything in front of you by the end of the game to understand what they do to earth   it s citizen   and even other creature they enslave on their conquest before   and none of the character need to straight up explain it to you   and that allow instead for more character centric dialogue   which I find incredibly charming    all in all   even if you didn t like hl    get this game   and I guarantee you you will enjoy it   it       deserve the reputation it have   and I enjoy it a ton

incredible game that scare the hell out of I when I be in my     s   even for a video game it be so well do   but I don t fancy first person shooter   and I don t play they because they seem dumb   but this one be awesome and realistic   give I goosebump and I never finish the game because I be too scared to play it   but now I m on a quest to finish it
I m with the science team
its self explanatory
be a scientist that go around hit alien and intergalactic soldier with a crowbar be fun
I can still remember wake up on the release day to play this before school   replay it now with full setting on and it still amaze I the quality of this game        
my college teacher guilt trip I into play it   pretty good
gud game  
big day today   freeman
half life    rtx update please
incredible game   brilliant sequel to an already amazing game   must play at least once a lifetime
   great game   fear for my life many time   protect as many people as I could   it s I   barney from black mesa   I love the gravity gun   and       you dr   breen
this game be beutiful   not only the story be tell perfectly as a sequel   if you have play the first one and like it play this one also
it s half life     I mean what be there to say really   just play it if you haven t already
a masterpiece with limitlesssss potential   cliffhanger ending be very difficult to get right but now and again one be use to extreme affect   the end and the map lead up to the end of hl   be paramount   the absolute chaos that be   follow freeman   be a total change in pace not just for this title but for half life overall    our benefactor   flip what many may consider a whirlwind from the prior map to overwhelming power while add a few narrative drip which will quench your thirst for week to come    dark energy   continue the power trip with a great memorable strider encounter and rework some of the first game s reactor climbing section into a well pace   think out and engage boss fight    what about the rest of the game    point insertion   set the whole tone for the game especially if you re not expect the setting which be to come    a red letter day   reunite you with a retconned scientist pal and security pal from black mesa   the hev suit be return to you even though the g man allow you to keep it from your last linear adventure   you even meet the girl here   the girl   talk about a totally different experience to the first game   one could go on and on with every map about some set piece   vista   encounter   fight and character but those word would be waste because half life    must be play to pick up what the game be put down   make sure you play the first title because you will be quite shocked and confuse upon start up half life    if you do   you wouldn t want to miss out on that   would you    the right man in the wrong place can make all the mistake in the world and get away with it   while undoubtedly a masterwork of interactive fiction   the flaw will stand out upon what be otherwise perfection   unlike it s predecessor   half life    can suffer from the occasional lapse in good signposting for the player in term of navigation   this only rear it s ugly head a couple time   once in   we don t go to ravenholm   when try to find a lever which blend into the texture around it then again after defeat a pair of menacing enemy on a rooftop in   follow freeman   be tell to   head to the horse    but no path seem to exist until you move towards the end of girder and see the exit which be totally hide from view otherwise   not a big deal in the scheme of thing but it do take about ten minute of intense searching to realize what to do in both case    jumping puzzle be frequent in half life but they be much less abundant in it s sequel   that be until you get to   sandtrap    more or less   the entire map be one huge jumping puzzle where touch the ground will set you back to the point of have to quick load   the puzzle here aren t rocket science but the constant jumping from one place to the other on physics object get tiresome and annoying when the physics glitch from be clip by the player and geometry   half life    do physics so well that almost every game after it have to have physics but walk on top of physics object be not part of half life    s forte   love the whole pheromone thing though    nova prospekt be when the game start to heat up if   highway      come off as too easy despite the gunship   you ll see more than three combine come at you at once and the map get more corridor like ala the first game   it s one of the well map in the game but valve could have handle the two   boss   encounter here a little well as circle strafe more or less prevent the enemy from be able to attack you   too bad   could have be a real treat like the strider towards the end of the game    my last real downer here be not a gameplay or map design problem so I ll make it brief   it s a wee writing detail   retconne eli   kleiner and barney to know gordon personally always seem cheesy to I   who know   maybe the event of half life    be just one instance in a time ocean of instance and this time these guy be gordon s good friend   that say   the hero worship in this game be just shy of world of warcraft post the burn crusade level and it pain I when nobody npc hail I as the next jesus christ   there could have be a well way to portray gordon without it feel saccharine    oh yeah   one more thing    water hazard   and   highway      boat and drive section of the game nothing short of an excellent sequence of event except for that one part during the airboat ride when you have to drive on top of concrete tube without fall off   don t let anyone tell you the airboat and the buggy suck   it just wasn t perfect     half life    have some more recognizable flaw when compare to it s predecessor   for that   I can t say it s the good game of all time   however   what I can say be that the gameplay really have become more varied than what come before it and make for some great moment   the narrative present here be just as interesting in city     as it be in black mesa but with the jump in tech it be portray in a superior way   enemy s remain similar between the two along with how the enemy be present   which be to say masterfully   so that s a draw   the addition of a robust physics system make the world come to life and add new type of puzzle   airboat ride and drive section be well do and a nice change of pace from what be expect   great facial animation for the time   half life s range of weapon be more robust than the   nd game s but the rocket launcher feel well to use in two while the crossbow feel well in one   so to I it s another draw    here we go   I ll just get to it           would play again   probably every couple year    didn t leave I as floor as the first game but I be still floor   be you follow all this
nice game good fps and graphic one of the good monster game
ravenholm      we don t go there anymore
need I say anything
wake up mr   freeman   wake up and smell the ashe   
to many bug   luckily you get bugbait to counter the bug and use they against your enemy
classic game   what else be there to say
gta    before half life    be crazy
great
I be speechless   I be think that you could not top half life one   but since I play this     my gaming life will never be the same   we want half life     
there be a myth that some student use this game for study their physics exam
the real half life be the friend we make along the way
gor freem smash more allen with crober
   such a fun game the game be hard but its fun at the same time good story
   I finish the game in one day      the game be revolutionary     amazing lore
not go to die until half life    release
great game
I like
amazing game
just finish my   rd run   this will never ever get boring   top tier character   top tier story   top tier level   good game ever
this     year old shooter still hold up   I think this be one of the most perfect game for people who like first person shooter    the gunplay be smooth   quick and the legendary source ragdoll make it even more satisfying   it s graphic will obviously show its age by now but it still look incredible even today   the water effect be still among the good I have ever see   however all that doesn t even come close to the immersion this game have   physics puzzle   the gravity gun   general interaction with other object and the opportunity half life    give you to shape and prepare a battlefield to your liking make this the ultimate sandbox experience   it s no wonder that garry s mod be as good as it be    the only real critique I have this long after release be that there aren t enough moment in the game with pure gunplay   most of the time there be some kind of modifier such as a vehicle   an army accompany you   the game turn into td for a section   etc    it would have be nice if there be more straightforward gunning in between these section   something the episode of half life    do a lot well    generally   if you plan to play half life    I recommend get it with the orange box   which include its episode as well   and portal   which be extremely good too  
game nearly as old as I but boy do they cook hard       
if you play this game your brainrot will be cure
its the second half life game
it s a true masterpiece           it be a game that you must play at least once in your life
ooga booga
great game   such underrated gem   I wish more people would knew about   also the modding community would love this I guess
I have an unhealthy obsession with crowbar   I own multiple crowbar   and a breaker bar that be tall than I   this game permanently alter my brain chemistry
nice
yes

""
   half life    yes yes yes   half life     maybe november           
you probably want the dark and griddi version of this game but this still hold up as one of the good game of all time   if you don t mind the puzzle or not know where to go sometimes
farewell brother   I fear I deliver to a dark place   may the light of light illuminate your path   look to your own      salvation
I m not crazy   a man with a briefcase walk past and disappear when I check
absolute masterpiece   your   half life   be waste if you have never play it        
its good
I m abit late to write this almost     year ago this master piece be create for at its time its highly advanced and in my opinion the good game ever create if it be finish valve do not make mistake
       I hate drive in this game
very skibidi sigma should play
good pc game ever   kendrick
I love u gabe
r I p   tony todd              
prepare for unforeseen consequence
  the unofficial adaptation of         to video game
I hear that there be half life    leak in this game and I find all of they and now I will show you all   
do I even need to say why
sonic the hedgehog
it be no exaggeration to call this one of the good fps   hell even one of the good video game of all time   absolute banger of a game right from the start   you re immediately throw into a world with so much intrigue and mystery   with each chapter build upon this   from the dystopian infrastructure of city     to the antlion cover sand beach   every chapter be fill to the brim with variety both visually and mechanically   action pack shoot fest   borderline survival horror   and even some awesome vehicle section   the world be incredibly interactive   be able to pick up and throw just about any item   see that can on the floor   pick it up and throw it at a combine officer   if an item look like you can interact with it   you most likely can   couple with great sound design   music   and write   half life    be one of the premier fps available   the game be already at an amazing price but frequently go on sale for     or less   play   this   game   you win t regret it
half life    be a perfect fit to be the sequel of the epic masterpiece half life   word can not describe my history with the source engine game   
peak
half life  
heck yeah
the good          game in the wolrd
masterpiece forever
poison headcrab suck                but the rest of the game be rlly good
I remove my wifi so I get    achivement after complete the whole game in       houir lol
fun game   much well than the first if only they release a third game   
this be literally the good thing I have ever play
still wait on half life  
gordon freeman
half life    when    it s be     year
god bless john valve
probably the good fps ever if we re be honest
it s good and it s like one of the    game on here I can run on my computer
good game   still be good to this day   thank valve
I just wanna play this game   I do not have it   
it s an amazing game          and I get it for a discount of like    euro   for this amazing game   but   the lore and backstory be extremely disturbing   especially the citadel   its a slavery fill auto factory for the combine force   and the headquarters of the combine   and the poor combine human soldier get horribly treat in training   this game need the   rd version out asap    but I recommend not listen to the song in the file distort trumpet
a thrilling campaign pack with unprecedented level of immersive world building   boundary push physics   and exhilarate combat indeed    if you want to be sum sort of scientist   or you re just a geek   this be for you I m neither of those and I still enjoy    its not like any other game    very cool   very swag   I like it
dog be a bad ass      
good one
yo this game suck

carton peeman

nobody s go to read this review   so I ll just say I m gay
first playthrough review time    half life     release in       and develop by valve   be know for its excellent plot and gameplay for its time   it place player in a detailed   immersive world with an engage gameplay experience    the game introduce new way to interact with object and the environment   the level be very well design   offer a mix of action and challenge    this game have greatly impact other game and establish its developer as a lead company   the technology use be very advanced for its time   with realistic effect and graphic   even though the half life series be release in the late      s to early      s   it still receive occasional compatibility update and bug fix   this generally indicate that there be still a very active player base for the series    overall   half life    be a groundbreake classic that set new standard for storytelle   gameplay   and technology in gaming in the early      s   its new feature and lasting impact make it an important part of gaming history
this didn t age well at all

what be you gordon   some kind of free man
it s perfect   everything    character    story tell   physics     I wish we could see beta version of half life    but what we get be a masterpiece even more enjoyable than half life  
very good           the only disappointment in this game be that you will not finished it by complete the story   you will need to buy dlc call half life episode    and     so yeah good cashgrab   and unfinished game       story     masterpiece    good    ok    average    boring    bad    no story    graphic     photorealism    beautiful    good    decent    bad    ms paint    gameplay fun     ride of your life    the kind of fun you ll remember    good amusiment    nothing special    repetitive    boring and hard to enjoy    I d rather watch emoji movie    bug polise     never have any    minor bug    can get annoying    ruin the game    the game itself be a bug    audio sound music     eargasm    amazing    good    ok    nothing special    earrape    difficulty     dark soul      difficult    significant brain usage    easy to learn    hard to master    normal    easy    my     year old grandma could play it    worth buy     yes    wait for sale    no
   kinda horror but I recommend
overrate in my opinion    I m not really that into shooter   but I ve play a bit of halo and I love metroid prime   I d hear a lot of good thing about half life       so when hl   go free I play it and think it wasn t the great game ever but be pretty good    I really don t have a ton to say about this game since my feeling on it be pretty meh   its a good game   but for the universal praise it have garner   I expect more   it just feel like a shooter with some neat idea   but not   great game of all time   material
I hate ni                                                                                              I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
one thing I do not know why it do not even matter how hard you try keep that in mind as I design this rhyme to explain in due time all I know time be a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swing watch it count down cuz at the end of the day the clock tick life away its so unreal   
if u say this game rip off skibidi toilet your a horrible person maybe think again
lambda locator achievement be at        even though I collect all      my day be ruin and I will never forgive this game for rob I of       in one run
prety good game but y r the model be just copy from skibidi toilet
meh   just an ordinary game    
skibidi toilet gameeeeeee
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   it s half life     a masterpiece   it s feel funny to write a review for this  
masterpiece
I can t believe they make a spin off on garry s mod

I be hope for g man sex update but we ll just have to wait for ht    half team strike     which will surely have sex update

btergdfvgrthg
pretty awful or something idk I never play the game
thgey steal this gaorm from gmod
skibidi toilet    origin
this game be more of a showcase of the physics system the game be      drive around an empty map       pick up object and the rest be the actual shooter game   for the year that it come out its good but not as fun as the first game
first hour be funny   but the game get boring real quick   no objektive too   feel more like a sandbox game rather than a story game
bore
game suck and the gameplay be trash and the plot be ass   but      alyx have a gyat      
skibidi gordon

skibidi toilet game
most overrated game of all time
   I stg dis        look just like this one assistant teacher back in   th grade fr   never know his name nor ever speak to he I just remember see he only in the cafeteria during lunch which be usually around    pm       pm   I vaguely remember he wear a light blue polo shirt   tuck in his tan khakis with a brown leather belt with a shiny buckle
please reward this comment   I still have       point leave to buy those slut avatar and background   give I thumb up   and you will grow   cm   reward this and you will grow    cm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
I understand why people be so fanatic for this game   this series and the episode   I just do not think they hold up too well     year later and that s okay    the theming for the world be really interesting   I just do not find the moment to moment gameplay very satisfying in the way portal or even a tf   or cs do   the character be fine and line be deliver in a way that suit but never rock my sock   the episode continue to build on the moment to moment but still just could not do it for I   honestly   the good expirence I ve have with the series be alyx   and that s past the vr expirence   as be   hl   be a fine game long past its time an while its engine and physics mechanic   much like the in game storytelling of hl   be monumental to the fps genre   I just do not fin they hold up    especially when the fanbase   like all overwhelming and occasionally obnoxious fanbase   look at you undertale   life be strange and portal   just can not let go
gmod make I think this game be fun
I bea the game        hour
erm     what the sigma
problem with this game be it feel like it s really on rail   not that the first one wasn t   but this be more campy and doesn t really have that many new interesting mechanic
it s basically just a skibidi toilet clone
absolute crap
pretty boring for an over hype game   as mush as I didn t like the first one   I d still rather play that one again over this
actually overrate
   my friend who I make half life    map with he say if I post a review on this game and it get      like and     award that he will buy I a new computer with intel igay    and ryzen       please I need they     they very very very gooddddddd pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I need it   
   gabe I will touch you so bad you will have ptsd from I you                  for create follow freeman I will follow you until you rape I you little          die
first   let I just say that I ve own half life    for almost     year   I ve always hate it   the vehicle segment make it so unbearably hard to enjoy that it take I almost     year to finally have the patience to finish this game   in that time   I ve play through half life   oppose force   and blue shift dozen of time   and play through      different hl   mod   as well as gunman chronicle   which be extremely similar   same engine and graphic etc   and black mesa   and a few black mesa mod   but half life     the character   the story   but most of all the gameplay and weapon   just absolutely suck    I always argue that there s a very good reason we never get half life       be use as a   show off trial   for the source engine for valve   similar to how half life alyx be use to show off vr   valve doesn t care about make game   they make so much money from the steam platform   why would they ever need to make software   but that s not even the big reason   for I   it s the scatter story   what would they really do that would be unique special that hasn t already be do in other game    half life    just feel like a demo more than a complete game   visually it s great   I love the graphic from that era   hell   many of my favorite game visually be from the mid      s   but it s the repetitiveness of enemy and lack of unique one   the lack of a xen section   and how short the game actually be if you take away the time we must waste on annoying vehicle section   plus   the choice of weapon and how painful they be to use be just mindboggle   how do we get here   like what the hell happen   half life    have the funn to use weapon of almost any game of the era   right there with quake    and perfect dark and unreal tournament    then you get to     and it s like everything be just   complete dogcrap   to make thing bad   the maximum ammo by default of the weapon be horribly low   the crossbow be cool but it s like a very show shoot insta gib weapon that doesn t even fully hit on fire because it be of course   a crossbow and not a beam   the rpg doesn t have a non track mode   the grenade be terrible to try and aim   the revolver be slow and underpowered   the pistol be underpowered and inaccurate   I could keep go but you get the point   how can we enjoy a fps if the weapon suck this badly    overall   I would say half life    be a   what could have be   game   it s only worth play because it s half life   you take away gordon freeman and that shiny hl logo and make the same game as a new franchise and it would be about a      rate game   and would have be consider a massive flop   but because we love half life so much   it seem so much great than it really be   half life    will always be my favorite single player campaign fps game   but    be my least favorite   it wasn t fun   and I don t think I ll ever play it again without serious weapon mod   and skip vehicle portion with no clip      year it take I to force my way through it   like eat a rotten piece of cheese begrudgingly   I hope there would be a cool xen area at the end or something fun finally but nope   the energy gun stuff be definitely cool but it wasn t enough to make the entire game worth play           at the most but   if you ve never play this and don t know anything about half life   don t play this   play the original game and oppose force
it be a puzzle game   I do not like puzzle   it be a combat game   combat piss I off         do not recommend for idiot
motion sickness
alright   the game be innovative   it be a big deal for a reason   it have age like milk   like all valve game   honestly   I keep wait for the game to start   I get to the last room of portal thinking   this be the long tutorial I have ever deal with    this game have full on cocaine nosejob adhd   it keep try to be every genre of game and do it for about     minute at a time in multiple hour of gameplay   the fact that the game doesn t use normal cutscene and instead do it in engine while the player be part of it be cool   but they should have establish that gordon be literally mute because it feel like he s a moron    why be he the messiah   why be that not consider really weird    the vehicle     they re heinous to control with key and not much well with a controller   the physics make no sense   cool that it be add to game   and impressive for the time   but it s just wild   what weigh what   what can be pick up     bizarre    now excuse I while I rage play it with a script to allow I to aim    I m still amazed that isn t an option
idk
boring   episode    and    be well

good story but really boring gameplay
overrate asf
long ahh game
gud game where s half life  
this game be so               it make I lose my testicle   when the game get start all the lady come to I think the gman be from skibidi toilet but the fact be that it be half life    and nobody like this           game so honestly take your       and throw it away into a       register for your       game epic game this game make I lose my mind especially the chapter   dxr ac   it suck so much I have to kill my testicle
look I know this game be a classic or whatever   but here be a summary of my half life    experience     get trap in low ground with dude shoot at I and drop explode thing on my head    get trap in a small room with tongue monster who be try to eat my face and or spinny blade robot who be try to cut my skin    get trap in a small room for a very long time where I wander back and forth and try to figure out how to get out while an annoying announcer voice repeat some phrase    repeat   this   apparently   be people s idea of a good time   it s not mine
it s like half life if you suck out all the soul and good gameplay   and replace they with      bad forgettable and unfun mechanic
this game rip off skibidi toilet
title   half life     overrate   politically drive garbage   I finally bite the bullet and play half life     a so call   classic   from the early      s   after hear endless praise for it   I expect at least a decent experience   instead   I be assault with a half bake narrative   laughably outdate gameplay   and shameless political propaganda that seem eerily relevant today   if this be what pass for a masterpiece   gaming be a mistake    first   let s talk gameplay   the whole gravity gun nonsense what s the big deal   I pick up box and can   and maybe launch a tire at a mutant   groundbreaking   hardly   they put way too much focus on these   innovative physics    which   frankly   any game with a decent physics engine could do today without the smug self importance   I ve see well object manipulation in bargain bin puzzle game    and what s up with the enemy   they re either mindless zombie or dystopian soldier that look like they come out of a      s   evil communist   propaganda poster   half life    try to make these   combine   character seem menacing   but they re just clich   after clich    could valve have be more on the nose   it s like they want to serve up the most ham fiste   fight the oppressive regime   storyline possible   it s not subtle   it s not clever it s just pander to people with che guevara poster who think every government be out to get they    the game s political overtone be mind numb   every area scream anti capitalist dogma and   the government be evil   rhetoric   be this a game   or an anti establishment pamphlet   the developer be clearly try to shove their agenda down player   throat   drum up rebellion as if we re all suppose to believe that our world leader be one step away from put we all in concentration camp   there s a fine line between set a dystopian scene and openly manipulate player   and valve launch itself mile over that line    the character development   nonexistent   gordon freeman be just a mute physicist with no personality   alyx vance   supposedly a   strong female character    spend most of her time cheerlead gordon   offer nothing to the story besides be a tool for valve s lazy attempt at diversity   and don t even get I start on the g man   this weird   speech impair guy who s suppose to be mysterious or something   but he s a stand in for government surveillance   right   real subtle   valve    then there s the horror of the   infamous   ravenholm section   why do people love this   it s a pointless detour fill with predictable jump scare and laughably bad zombie design   plus   if they want to take a stab at the horror genre   they should have at least make it scary   instead   it s like valve decide to throw a bad resident evil rip off into their political diatribe of a game just for variety s sake    half life    be an overrated   overtly political mess that only serve as a reminder of how pretentious the gaming community can be   for anyone consider play this so call   icon   of a game   my advice be simple   save yourself the headache
this game suck
meh
 
very overrated imo   story be bland   gameplay be ok but nothing great   physics be fun if you like to mess around   I m not that kind of guy   and I be pretty bored and motion sick while play   idk how I get it    overall         very overrated   play it if you re intreste   and you might enjoy the game more then I
so we do not own our game huh   this be why I will always wait for super good cheap sale even if I go year and may risk not see a game   i d rather wait to see it finish and polish in a few year after its release date     since most game release as mess    or indie game when you can tell they have put the effort in   some hide indie gem be   aaa quailty    for waaay more affordable price    not that   aaa   matter much to we any more but I want to rub certain corpo s brown nose in the fact some of we think their product on not worth what they use to be   what htey claim and lie about still be     tryign to make yard sale illegal s    could not do it   now they just take away physical copy   cause they do not believe in sharing cause they be souless and greedy     now they make we think twice about even buy something from they at all    not very smart   how steam have fall    one day they will take everything we once have   and turn we into empty husk   and once the empty husk have nothing leave to lose they might just try to take back what they deserve by any mean necessary
I know the visual   physic and engine in general of this game be revolutionary for it s time   but this be overrate and overpraise as        I can t understand what s all the ball suck for this game   the story be retarded and make no sense   somehow the combine be the strong specie in the world and conquer entire planet but somehow a beta look guy can defeat they with an iron stick   the character design be also horrible   the gameplay be even bad   just walk from point a to point b   shoot everything in front of you and solve puzzle   yes   because that s literally what happen in real life    this game get its reputation thank to coomer for gaben and valve   because if it have to be analyze with a cold mind it s just boring and shallow   the only good thing this game be useful for be gmod   and the only reason to buy the expansion of hl   be to have more prop for gmod   and gmod isn t even that good    you will like this if you re a nerd and love retarded story whose gameplay could be well describe as a walk through a corridor   sad
I don t like thjs game   the gameplay be stupid   and I hate the character throughout the game    due to they be highly stupid and half of they be joke around when the world be literally at war    the combine be somehow weak and the lore around they make no sense   you tell I the nihilanth and vortigaunt home planet get take over by they   when half of the synth   the strider and the gunship especially   get take down by like    or    rocket launcher   and the human make the magnusson device in the sequel that literally one shot strider   and the nihilanth specie be suppose to be even more powerful then human how do they lose to the combine when human literally beat they in half life     not to mention that the overwatch soilder be suppose to be strong then regular human   but they get one shot by a revolver which be suppose to one shot a human aswell   and don t even mention that this be only a    fraction    of the combine   city     be their main base on earth   and in half life    they be send every military soilder and artillery at gordon freeman   when he and the rest of the human destroy they all   and the human military somehow    losse    to the combine due to they be so dumb and not have a freaking plan to defeat they   and they do in the sequel and defeat they   easily as cake   but in the seven hour war they didn t think they could defeat they and they give up   and the weak combine win   so you tell I the human and the nihilanth species couldn t defeat the combine due to they give up and be dumb   alright maybe the xen alien cause the human to struggle but    earth s military be suppose to strong   how can you lose to both the xen alien and the combine when they be weak as hell     yep   I don t like this game   and infact I hate it
just another white mans power fantasy
they steal the skibidi toilet character    
zombie chopper achievement make I be angry
having previously play the orange box version on the xbox       and watch many playthrough prior to        etc    I can say this be a certify classic   make I want a crowbar now    
fun
when do full life come out
      the legacy of this game        everything it do well        every lastdev that work on this game   I understand that this game be way ahead of this time but it have some insanely clunky difficulty spike and no sense whatsoever for lead the player where to go at time   there s a handful of instance where a random not in any way highlight door be the path ahead in some corner of the map   why do strider tank    or    rpg shot   in today day and age I can still see why this game have leave the impact it do   but holy moly the game have low low
contemporary review of an iconic legacy game   I just feel like half life    do not age well   I would have give this game high mark at the time of release         graphic         you forget what reality be    beautiful    good    decent    bad    don t look too long at it    ms do        gameplay         very good    good    it s just gameplay    mehh    watch paint dry instead    just don t        audio         eargasm    very good    good    not too bad    bad    I m now deaf        audience         kid    teen    adult    grandma        pc requirement         check if you can run paint    potato    decent    fast    rich boi    ask nasa if they have a spare computer        game size         floppy disk    old fashioned    workable    big    will eat      of your   tb hard drive    you will want an entire hard drive to hold it    you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the datum        difficulty         just press   w     easy    easy to learn    hard to master    significant brain usage    difficult    dark soul        grind         nothing to grind    only if u care about leaderboard rank    isn t necessary to progress    average grind level    too much grind    you ll need a second life for grind        story         no story    some lore    average    good    lovely    it ll replace your life        game time         long enough for a cup of coffee    short    average    long    to infinity and beyond        price         it s free     worth the price    if it s on sale    if u have some spare money leave    not recommend    you could also just burn your money        bug         never hear of    minor bug    can get annoying    ark   survival evolve    the game itself be a big terrarium for bug                                                           
overpraised and boring         play this if you like to walk around barren wasteland and engage in combat with broken       ai for several hour   idk about all of you dork but I play video game to have fun   this game lowkey get to get take down for false advertising    half life     huh     that s a funny way to spell    walk simulator        final verdict do not buy this game   and if you live in a barren polluted desert with a bunch of angry crackhead just go outside with a crowbar   you will literally get a well vr version of this game   I will never understand the praise behind this game   be it the story   cause its clearly not the gameplay
I buy this game when it originally come out at a local walmart in jacksonville   al     I remember wonder if my pc could even run it at the time   it be an old school e machine desktop    steam be insanely new at the time nothing like it be today if I remember correctly     I didn t beat the game on pc back then    but do correct that when the orange box be release on console and enjoy every minute of it   now almost     year later I build a new pc capable of run cyberpunk on ultra setting with no issue   but I decide to revisit this classic instead     this game be incredible   as far as gameplay and story go     there be some frustrating area but as a whole this game still hold up   I be plan on play through episode    and      but this have I debate on invest in a vr headset so I can play half life   alyx     it be insane that later this week this game will be    yr old   as of this writing it be               I wonder if gabe will do anything to celebrate it   
classic

over all a fantastic experience
corrupt my save twice but otherwise its a great game   well than hl
it s a classic for a reason   it s     year old and it still rock
one of the good game of all time   require think   expand upon hl   have to offer and it s expansion    absolutely amazing game   the intro of the game be much more action pack than the first   and it s only continue to ramp up as I play along   I be so grateful for the    th anniversary of half life   because without the attention that it receive   I would have never go and buy they all on sale   good purchase I have make with a series in a while   here s hope the reason they do the    th anniversary be that steam plan to release half life    soon   I d be all over it   can not recommend this game enough   blow my mind that counter strike be a literal mod of half life as well   
I have not play very much of this game   and I can already see why it s so highly regard   why it s place on a pedestal of gold and ascend beyond divinity in the eye of many   who do not just play it   but deeply understand the intricacy of its sheer perfection   upon start this game for the first time and feel myself bask in the glow of my monitor show the iconic valve logo   with the sound effect that hit my brain in a way I didn t know be possible   I realize what I be in for   the legendary g man wasn t just speak to gordon freeman when he say   wake up and smell the ashe    he be speak truth into my very soul   he be inform I that every moment of my life before this one   when I think I could possibly understand just how amazing the format of video game be   I have be mistake   now that my essence have be feel by true knowledge that in turn allow I to enter the vast expanse of wonder in this universe   I have come to know the simple truth   this be simply the good use of the format of video game ever   I do not exaggerate when I say that every single person who doesn t experience this purest of storytelle and interactive artistic masterpiece be commit a heinous act against themselves   to never play half life    be essentially equivalent to slather your own body in the filth and plague of century past and to then ask to be allow a seat at the table of normal human conversation be simply ridiculous   your every keystroke in this game feel as though an unrestricted surge of otherworldly magic be course through your flesh and soul at once and connect your be to that of gabe newell himself   every mouse click and gunshot in this game be the equivalent to one hundred thousand of the most hedonistic   orgasmic pleasure know to any creature within one hundred decillion cubic light year   the cosmic high of immensely intoxicating positive energy gift to we by a single screenshot of this game be enough to prevent the heat death of every universe   valve   I know it sound like a lot to live up to   your past have be so perfect you can never top it   but if you make a half life    that s anywhere close to decent   it will be perfect too just by association   you know what must be do   thank you

this game be fun   it look excellent to I in       I m especially impressed with the water play it back   and I really enjoy the slightly ominous story that kind of lurk in the background   I never really understand it back in the day   but play it again as an adult there s so much to find   a little patience can go a long way in this game
perfect game

   good game
      
                 
I m confused
if you somehow don t already own this or have never play this   do yourself a favour   it be    even still nearly     year later    the good game ever make
the freeman game be not free   but it be good
be it that time again   mr   freeman
where do the soda go
still great today    suspenseful   action pack and a post apocalyptic vibe
good game and good era of gaming   thank you for the memory valve   p cube
its the one the only half life  
the good video game of all time
definetily the good and most phenomenal game for the       year   the story   soundtrack and atmosphere be awesome and combat be still feel good and satisfy
k
after all this time     always    hl   be one of the good game in history
great       it on stream even
again   all valve game be the good game     play this game   trust I you will not regret it   but play half life or black mesa first   so you can get more comfortable in gordon s place   I mean   hev suit   you will understand half life    more if you go back and play the prequel
shut up and take my money   part two
it s good   that s the review

simply the good game I have ever play   no game have conclsivly impress I as much as this game do   I play it back when it game out and I still do sometimes   because its a masterpiece    not just the game craft and storytelling but the coding be so clean that it play as smooth as velvet pancake   even on my old potato     I be still wait to get a big budget blockbuster movie trilogy of this amazing scify story   maybe one day  
lamda
it s the g o a t   get it     now
  pick up that can    trash can cop
be there really anything more to say about this game than    it s half life     it s one of the great game ever make   go play it
a true classic amazing world building
don t be stupid   get the orange box
it s half life     you re not even here to decide if you want to buy this   you ve already play this game through like ten time   you be just bored and want to read some review
teh soundtrack be liek aphex twin have a bipolar seizure but be rly kewl game   lossa alinein n dr   brian sayn   wellcome    teh    city   all makin I remind of sofia   b lgarya   be s my mimi    pipi use t make bosintang dog soup
a good game even for today s standard   fall short to hl   thou   do a lot of thing well but it do some other badly   the world feel quite empty   the map be not nearly as good as hl    feels influence by counter strike   there be some chapter that be amazing and other feel boring   not the good balance   the enemy variety be a bit scarce and once you get the gravity gun the crowbar be useless   it doesn t feel like tell a story   what the heck happen   want to be an action movie   a sci fi movie   all at the same time   command the squad be annoying   they get in the way all the time   very clunky   there be some really good moment and situation to overcome   all in all I recommend the experience   the price be fair   and I enjoy play it   again   
buy this game if you want to experience funny stuff in the source    engine or enjoy this game   however be aware that sometimes you will have visual glitch like hdr turn off randomly which mean you have to restart the game or try to fix it but I recommend this game alot if you want to beat it in    day like I   don t try that though just for the sake of your health  
   nice game
good game
the right player in the right game can make all the difference in the world
worth play   you will find great deal on sale

well than huntdown the freeman      
brm brm
                                    
it s not just a video game   this be a creation that lead to many new project and idea   it inspire ton of creative people to create their own game use some of the solution apply here   one of the good game that I sometimes revisit   it play so smoothly   so non stop   and so engagingly that you just can t distract yourself   truly a masterpiece that determine modern gaming
I like gordon fermate
diese spiel braucht keine rezension   diesis spiel braucht ein denkmal
fantastic
its quite obvious do I need to say something  
dog   
absolute fire
good game
be there anything I can say about the game that hasn t be say already   if you re a shooter fan you must play this game   personally I see how many of my favourite game be inspire and hell even use some of this game s sfx       
half life    be one of the good and most well know singleplayer fps game that I ve ever play on steam    the story take place after the event of half life    when you wake up as gordon freeman twenty year later by mysterious man name gman on earth that get take over by an interdimensional empire which be know as the combine   I love the main character such as gordon   alyx   barney and many other include npc   it s one of the most influential game ever make that lead to the creation of garry s mod   tf   and more    it s not only the main character   the npc such as male     the most popular npc in the half life series same thing as the scientist in half life     male     appear in meme   garry s mod and sfm   source filmmaker   video which shape the internet culture    I like how this game have psysic base puzzle mechanic such as lift up the the submerge ramp with plastic water barrel and pry barricaded wood with a crowbar revolutionize game in the future    I do like the post apocalyptic and dystopian environment on how the world be control and watch by the combine   the abandon building like junkyard   a town infest with headcrab zombie and more make the game more alive or once alive
still hold up to this day with the simple world reactivity   manipulating prop and slove puzzle   in fact I unironically think people should let their child play this game the puzzle be simple and good for teach youngin basic problem solve and yeah it might be scary at some point I e ravenholm I don t think it would be traumatise something I think everyone should play once    also the sound effect while crunchy be still fun and iconic still burn into my brain to this day   also also funny rag doll
perfect
all time classic
who this

tricky puzzle great story and well think out and a classic   and a shame for game not to move on this smooth anymore

this game be amazing   no matter how many time I restart the game to play from the beginning   or just go to ravenholm   I always enjoy it   this game change everything   funny story but I be explain the lore of the first    game and she think I be talk about a movie   go to show how good this game be even today
this game be perfection   everything about it be so good   the story   the gameplay   the voice act   literally every male citizen be voice by john p   lowrie   the guy who voice sniper in tf    this game be so influential it just blow my mind this game be make in        if this be still good and still hold up today I can t imagine how good half life    will be

   I d like to take a moment to address you directly   dr   freeman   yes   I m talk to you   the so call one free man   I have a question for you   how could you have throw it all away   it stagger the mind   a man of science   with the ability to sway reactionary and fearful mind toward the truth   choose instead to embark on a path of ignorance and decay   make no mistake   dr   freeman   this be not a scientific revolution you have spark    this be death and finality   you have plunge humanity into freefall   even if you offer your surrender now   I can not guarantee that our benefactor would accept it   at the moment   I fear they have begin to look upon even I with suspicion   so much for serve as humanity s representative   help I win back their trust   dr   freeman   surrender while you still can   help ensure that humanity s trust in you be not misguide   do what be right   dr   freeman    serve mankind  
incredible game   that age well and be totally worth play after     year   the sound and design of this game except for texture   be on top
the good game in the world ever
full life consequence   what have too be do
no snark but I get bug army and commit vehicular manslaughter without real world repercussion so that s pretty cool      mm soup   be also a really epic thing in this game
much enjoy and entertain
do I have to say any thing
in my opinion   this be the great game of all time   my play hour don t reflect it because I use to play alot back in the day offline and nowday I play the game use mmod so my playtime isn t track   but it s a game that I revisit normally   along with black mesa half life     and the two portal game   the lore on display here be some of the most well think out and intrigue lore one could experience across any form of medium   the gunplay be absolutely sublime   graphic still look amazing   the physics be still the good in the business   and the atmosphere of this game be unchallenged   it stick in your head for a while   whether it s your first time beat it   or your   th time around   it always stick with you and get you think   and the lore be leave just ambiguous enough for a lot of aspect of the story to be open to interpretation   amazing character   amazing weapon   and the holy grail of level design   steam exist because of this game   and so many other game grow out of hl    it be one of a kind and a must play for anyone with even a slight interest in game   the king of the boomer shooter
this and halflife   be the good game   ever

woah woah woah half life now that s something cool   well what can I say about the legend   here of course          because the plot be interesting and the shooter be also provide   despite the fact that the game come out in       it be still on top   play it you win t regret it
   its great overall but I can not get over the uncanny feeling of the game such as the zombie chapter            I stop play from how scared I be   highly reccomended
one of the good fps s ever make
it s half life     this classic still hold up and I have more fun play this than most aaa title

if you be look for an adventure   I tell you this game have it all   for a     year old game   this game be not bad   matter of fact this game if pretty damn great   for all the little detail you see its pretty cool   I get to say so for myself   but anyways if you be look to kill some combine alien   you find the right game  
I always come back to the freeman   my cozy game forever   it be practically timeless and worth any invest of time you put into it
one of the good and most influential game of all time    despite some date design still really fun and definite must play   even     year after release

my favorite game of all time   nuff say   
romania sim     
if you don t like this game   you don t like fps game   after all these year   they still can t make a game that rival this game   if valve ever get off their butt and make a hl    it would be the good selling game overnight   but I guess they make enough cash run steam    I would love to see a graphical update and the addition of ad
I pick thing up and throw they at people

second good game ever
the free man live    or something like that
it s kind of like skibidi toilet   but with way less gore and not as badass
I try so hard and get so far   but in the end it do not really matter
when I play it I remember the old good time
this be probably the most action pack game yet   the soundtrack and the level design be really good   despite the game literally change on how video gaming would work   this game give so many feeling   it s like   horror and action be mix in a game   where there be also some deep story behind and a good combat system   this game be awesome and deserve to be one forever and ever
I love the story of this game   I like the challange for achivment like the hev sign one   I like character in this game and I would deffinetly recommend it   I be not english so sorry for the grammar mistake

absolute cake of a game    the graphic be very good for       and it run like a champ on my dual core pc with uhd g   graphic at      x      high setting   the story be incredible    the level design be unique and non repetitive   the mechanic be absolutely incredible and very polished   some part might be a bit tough tho   overall this game be money well spend   strongly recommend episode    and    as an addition expansion to the main story game which add more mechanic and stuff into the game while keep the experience non clunky    fun    and polished
I understand why everyone want half life    now   absolute banger of a game   honestly crazy how good this game hold up nowadays   graphic look really good imo   another thing I find like about the game that there s not really any cutscene   all the story be tell in game

as an inexperienced hl enjoyer   it be good   I m too smooth brain for environmental puzzle   but it s good   I think a problem for people with a big backlog   I   be the fact that old game will show it s age   especially when you didn t grow up love that game   accept the art for what it be   I enjoy it   and will be excited for half life    in the next decade since it s existence have finally be confirm
   I really can t recommend this more   it have amazing gameplay with great environment and soundtrack I can t wait for half life

I ve beat it in school so its pretty good   only thing I do not really like about it be that you do not get any help you have to find it out yourself which be doeable but I get stuck alot
""
just finish half life     this game be way ahead of its time   I be shocked to see the aspect it have which now modern fps game be struggle to feature in their own   a       game like this have to be a miracle for half life    fan who enjoy they since        g man s character be more unsettling   I always have like he   since childhood   I get to know about half life    from garry s mod   since it be a mod of half life     g mod mostly revolve around my for you page when I be a child   great game   with story and mechanic   the sound design in this game be high on top   and the music hit differently   a fantastic story fps game to play   would recommend
yes
legendary
despite come out in       this game still hold up really well along side if not well than shooter action game that have come out recently   with such memorable character and a great atmosphere   the platforming can got straight to hell though
basically bill nye the science guy lore
good game
I didn t know ai could be so hateful
great game with well write story and gameplay
   peak life
good pc fps game ever
 
 
half life    good   piss
back when it first come out   I have dial up internet   and steam be not something my grandfather want on his computer s   either way   our internet be to slow to download steam   not to mention half life      now here I be in        and realize finally   today   that I have never play half life     I have however play half life    episode s         honestly feel like a kid again    half life    bring back memory I never get to make   
    yeah
my favorite   
I love the part where eli say   one thing I don t know why
its epik
the perfect game
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   oats
who win    an entire police force   manhack and barnacle who have smgs vs gordon freeman   a guy who just nonchalantly do not react to anything and also wield a pistol at the start of the game
good but couldn t bring myself to finish it
I can not tell you how many time I ve play this since it come out when I be a kid   make I happy that its still such a popular game give its age   in light of all the new game I ve play recently   hl   be such a simple game   there s only one way to play it   no looting   no alternate ending   no base building   you just pick up and play   and try to hold it together while everything be try to kill you
it start with one thing I don t know why it doesn t even matter how hard you try keep that in mind I design this rhyme to explain in due time all I know time be a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swing watch it count down to the end of the day the clock tick life away   it s so unreal didn t look out below watch the time go right out the window try to hold on   didn t even know I waste it all just to watch you go I keep everything inside and even though I try   it all fall apart what it mean to I   will eventually be a memory of a time when I try so hard and get so far but in the end it doesn t even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn t even matter   one thing   I don t know why it doesn t even matter how hard you try keep that in mind I design this rhyme to remind myself how I try so hard in spite of the way you be mock I act like I be part of your property remember all the time you fight with I I m surprised it get so thing aren t the way they be before you wouldn t even recognize I anymore not that you know I back then but it all come back to I in the end you keep everything inside and even though I try   it all fall apart what it mean to I will eventually be a memory of a time when   I try so hard and get so far but in the end it doesn t even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn t even matter   I ve put my trust in you push as far as I can go for all this there s only one thing you should know I ve put my trust in you push as far as I can go for all this there s only one thing you should know   I try so hard and get so far but in the end it doesn t even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesn t even matter
its hald life get it duhhh
good game
be a good about you have little bit life to survive the world rule by enemy    
yeah   of course it s a good game bro   just play it
can not believe they let gordon feetman fight the combine after the incident at black mesa with the foot scanner hd
half life     to this day   have one of my favorite all time story line that you can find in a first person shooter   definitely a very fun experience with plenty of replayability
it s a great game   I   myself be really bad at it sometimes
be that goebrgn frebjrd        
gorbon freeman  
  it s surface level storytelle   certainly   but symbol be powerful and this imaginary crowbar be nothing but pure symbology       the future always get here eventually   and often   it be a half life game that let I know when that future have arrive      noah caldwell gervais
in my opinion its well then the first from what I ve experience   all though it may just be I not having of complete the first game but personally I enjoy this one more
its good
still find myself play this game to this day   a great single player experience you find yourself come back to time after time

I wish more game be make like this today   I want an immersive and exciting linear fps that have zero grind or retention   just an engaging story in a gorgeous setting with fun mechanic   it ain t rocket science   yes look at you ubisoft and what you do to my beloved far cry   far cry    be well than any of the follow up with their nasty grind    studio need to save the grindy mechanic for genre that be grindy by nature   such as tide game etc   the irony be that I have probably play hl   and hl    and bms   over and over more time than any game with retention mechanic   no idea why my account say      hour play   I buy it at launch    its the perfect setting   story   visual and audio design and we need some new   non vr   adventure in this world   hl   be my favourite game of all time until black mesa source come out then that take the mantle   hl   sit in a close second    I hope we get to revisit black mesa in hl   if they ever release it   how cool would that be   imagine what all the year of xen overgrowth have do there   hl   omit too much xen flora fauna imo   bullsquid and houndeye etc should have all make it into the game along with all the cool combine stuff    anyway yes hl   be a masterpiece and I can still happily play it now   all these year on   and thoroughly enjoy it   I m hope the rtx update get release before I die   although if they remade hl   blackmesa and hl   with modern engine graphic then that might kill I from pure joy anyway   yo gabe   make hl   a mix of hl    hl   and some new jazz sprinkle on top    the valve logo and intro music still give I goosebump every time   please give we more from the half life world

yes
a game you play once or every    year
probably the good   valve   game in my opinion   rating       
I do not hold the nostalgic value for the half life series as anyone who get to experience the mechanic that the series introduce to the gaming world back when it release   in fact   I be fairly new to gaming as a whole when I first play half life    back in the day   and I do not understand gaming mechanic at all   so I get stick at a certain point   I recall something about have to climb turbine    so this have keep I from the series for these long year   I be glad I have the half life experience at least once in my life   having now complete hl   and episode          thank to the orange box
good time to be have here
