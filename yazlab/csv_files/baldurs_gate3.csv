bg   thrust you straight into the action with what amount to a three pronged battle between the soldier of a hellish realm   it tap into an adaptation of dungeon    dragon   ruleset   which doesn t mean fight play out with all the rad spell and nifty strategy of a tabletop campaign encounter
I buy    copy of this game     pound cheap than retail and I would ve pay full price if I know how much I d enjoy this game   it suck you in with a sheer mountain of content and detail   coop isn t linear and only    person progress   everyone in a squad of    can enjoy different scenario with character they enjoy build a bond with and not feel left out   this game deserve       game of the year    a big kieran game approval          starship trooper be poop
right after clear the first area   I get to a fight that seem impossible   turn out I need to backtrack and re play the first area because I didn t gain enough level while I be there   game use to do this to you a lot in the old day   I don t miss it

if you like this sort of turn base d and d style game   then its for you   I try it and it be not for I
I m a lil   late to the party   but this be the good rpg style game I ve play in a decade   if you re over     and love neverwinter night    this game surpasse that tenfold
this game be really   really good and you should play it
it s not a bad game by any mean   it s just that throughout my binge of this game play the righteous hero until the end I feel nothing for any of it   I didn t feel any emotional attachment at all to any of the character   the story   nor the world itself    like I guess the only thing that I somewhat enjoy from my entire playthrough be the and the    and before anyone recommend it   I honestly just can t bring myself to do another     hr playthrough with dark urge even to spice thing up   I m glad if people enjoy it   but I guess the game be just not for I
invest the time   its worth it
ngl I see why it win goty
the good game I have ever play
if you like d d and you like kiss people you ll probably like this game also karlach be good girl  
great game
bg   be amazing   I find myself come back to the game over and over again   all the character be well write   the story be immersive and the game be just beautiful
      hour in    it s an okay game   I guess    
wow
warning   do not play this game if you want a casual rpg experience   this game be a sweaty stress fest   mean for hardcore d d type   from the very begininng   even on normal difficulty   you have to manually save often   personally my autoave break somehow   and stop save after     save   I lose       min of gameplay several time   until I have finally have enough   and quit   if a game be go to have a learning curve this steep   there ought to be a warning somewhere
a game base off dnd   th edition         that give quite a bit of room for character build with class   multi class   and plenty of magical item that give plenty of varied play style   a bunch of fairly interesting companion with their own storyline that occur adjacent to the main storyline   a lot of choice that alter the path and ending of the game s main story and companion   personal story that give the game a lot of replayability    especially with all the different character build to play around with    additionally   there be a multi player option that open up the game to play with friend   or even other random player online   which can be a lot of fun to those who enjoy co op    difficulty mode be available   include an   honour mode   that introduce special ability for boss and a single save limitation as well as a   perma death   like feature that end a successful honour mode run if your character die    for those into modde   the game do feature some official mod support   and there may be additional mod outside of the official mod support as well    ultimately   great fun for those into medieval renaissance era fantasy game and turn base combat
I m just here to romance a hot vampire and live out my fantasy book fantasy      I promise I haven t just sit in the loading screen for     hour   I ve just have mod enable

one of the good game ever make   truly great   update seven   that add modding   do not work at all   I ve beat it twice without mod   once with a monk and a second time with a sorcerer   there be so many detail and side mission you can spend hour find out all the different outcome of choose different path and response to quest   it be awesome   just ignore all the mod in your play through   the additional of modding in the game ruin the ability to use any mod at all   even vortex and nexus mod do not work any more   the internal mod inside of the game do not work either   before they add the modding directly into the game   you could mod all you want with vortex or nexus   now   neither method work   mod be currently completely break   regardless   the game be wonderful without mod   mod be just for replay ability   still a great game
I do not have to rely on my friend show up to the session on time

one of the good game ever make   very relaxing and chill to play because of it be turn base combat   way well dialogue than dragon age veilgaurd

cheese
I lose my job recently and finally have the time to play this amazing game   totally worth the wait   I be enjoy every minute with it   if you re a fan of the genre you will not be disapointe
it s good
this game be goate
bg   be massive and fill with meaningful decision   give the player an enormous amount of freedom in both combat and dialogue   every single encounter be hand craft   and choice almost no one pick be just as flesh out as any other   my only real gameplay gripe   looting be more of a chore than something to look forward to   and exploration become boring by the end   once you ve already see all the good part   fight also get very bogged down when there be too many entity involve at once   but this be fairly rare    the writing be more of a mixed bag   the character writing be   mostly   solid   and companion interaction be easily one of the strong aspect of the game   the actual plot unfortunately disappoint   largely become a muddled mess by the end   it s never painful to get through   but very few moment have I fully engage   there be a noticeable drop in quality from act        to act     and I have to push myself to see it through to the end    worth play if you re even remotely interested in rpgs   but keep your expectation ground
this game be amazing    I can t even describe it   it fill I with joy to play this game   I play it several time in early access and complete it once the game be fully release    I m almost sad that it s over   for everyone who love rpgs   this be your game   it might feel strange at the beginning   especially for those who have play divinity before   as it s different but fear not   embrace it and let the game draw you in    I truly hope that larian studio will create another rpg   or even a fourth part of baldur s gate   let s see what the future hold    there s only one thing I didn t like as much about this game   though it s more of a personal preference   the main character doesn t speak in the dialogue   I think this be a miss opportunity   and for those who don t prefer it   perhaps just add an option to deactivate it    final word   if you love storytelle   complex character   and immersive gameplay   don t miss out on this masterpiece   it s a journey worth take   one that will stay with you long after the credit roll
this game continue to blow I away       
I like the thought of d d but I don t have friend and I read smut      so this game be perfect for an alpha female like I

honestly one of the good rpgs ever make and my favorite game   highly recommend it   especially if you love turn base combat   this game will make you laugh   make you cry   make you check all of your teddy bear for bomb   question if your friend have be replace with shapeshifter and why the mailman keep show up when your dad isn t home   honestly the only thing that could improve this game be if they give wyll more content
wait far too long to purchase this game   it be amazing and I deeply regret not buy it on release   final score so far            point because rng zeus hate I and this game be merciless   great story   well rounded combat   and well write dialogue that really make I feel connected to the other character   even the non party character   too much so   I be go to have a terrible time try to play an evil play through
pretty good
only one line mention drizzt    
I will start by say I love turn base rpg game and know I d love the combat in baldur s gate      however what I didn t expect from my time with the game be how bad the character be   I find they extremely annoying and boring to the point I didn t make a connection with any main character or npc   there be no event or scene that make I go   let s goooooo   I be just push through hope thing get interesting    I really want to like this game on the surface it s everything I want but after actually play the d d style of story telling be really drag it down    I play the       out of the witcher    and cyber punk and the story telling and character have I on the edge of my seat and I guess that s what I be hope for here    probably the most overhyped game of all time lol
it s pretty good
believe the hype
almost      hour in and I have never make it out of act         
      hour in   yet still a virgin   bring it on
good game
just buy it
yes   its the good game I ve ever play
astarion   
goate af no cap
three word    good game ever
I m thirty five year old   I be divorce   and I live in a van down by the riiiiivveeerrrrrr
awesome
imo   baldur s gate    be one of the good rpgs ever make   the story   write   voice act be just top notch   variability of situation and outcome   the freedom of choice and roleplay be on unprecedented level   you re not just follow the story   you re make it   this be the first crpg that truly capture the spirit of a d d campaign    game be not perfect though   but most of the issue be technical   it s still bug as hell a year after release   some bug even block your progress in side quest   some mechanic be outright broken   game crash from time to time   control   ui ux be questionable at time   base system can not really sustain the complexity of the game   which often cause you fight the interface more than you fight the enemy   party and inventory management be particularly annoying    but overall I enjoy my time with the game   and its issue do not ruin the impression   so I could strongly recommend it to anyone who s into story rich tactical turn base crpgs
karlach reject I
beat chapter    after around    hrs   I d say it s pretty good so far
watch your party miss        hit in a row and get critte by goblin   save scum simulator   its like gambling but you only lose money once   or just move barrel inch by inch to secure victory
be careful who you romance   especially the bear   avoid the bear
they should add skibidi toilet to this gamne
get to spend eternity in hell with the one you love   slay demon and devil together as a doomslayer couple   worth it
amazing   goat for I
game good bang good dang good
would you recommend this game to other player      yes
if you like dnd but have no friend   this be the game for you   if like dnd and do have friend this be also the game for you
the gay wizard have bewitch I body and soul
I want to f   k the bear     why be it take so long   great game though
please buy this game   please play it   please give it a shot even if you be not much of a fantasy person    I start as a person who struggle so much with fantasy dnd esque game   then this game change I   for the well    I clock more hour in this game within a week than any other game I own   this game also have really   really good video controller input setting   I struggle a lot with extreme motion sickness due to bvd   I be really depressed because it prevent I from be able to play most video game for almost a decade   this game have really accessible controller setting that allow I to enjoy the game despite of my disability   thank you for make a game that allow I to enjoy game again   larian studio
bear sex
just buy this           game and don t even ask why
        it s be      hour already
I don t usually play game like these   however   this game have change that   I can see why this game win goty and it s because of how freely you can play it while keep that turn base style fresh
      game with        pr   baldur s gate    be still far superior    combat be boring because encounter design be just not good and no strategy outperform just consistently do as much damage as possible   not enough enemy mage sling crowd control so one party member with counterspell can invalidate entire boss fight    gear be so powerful it become more impactful than your actual class in many case   you have to actively nerf yourself by not use certain break mechanic for the game to have any challenge at all past level     even on honor mode ruleset   the game be just too easy    most of the companion be unlikeable and insufferable for at least the first act of the game except karlach and will   no good align character would willingly put up with astarion or lae zel s psychopathic behavior    story feel disjoint   like they take    separate plot and mash they together to make one barely cohesive    act structure
good game
its light   the sassy vampire twink both annoy and amuse I tho
game good   dragonborn hot
there be so much yapping oh my gosh   I will always love astarion     gay for he
near perfect game in term of gameplay   visual   storyline and more     star
multiplayer do not work with one of my friend and honestly after    day I feel awful for the guy and I feel so demotivated in try   I ve nearly get a full day worth of hour in try over and over and over again to play with he and still   he crash every time
as good as everyone else be say that it be
straight up jorkin it   and by it haha   lets just say   my peanit
   baldur s peak
ok
good game with good character
not enough tentacle
I m sorry   but the game be mid   it s not good and it s not bad   and that s the bad of it
negative review because astarion
this game be a buggy mess   with glitche camera   break convos   and impossible questline    I ve never have more fun with any game than bg    this game be so       massive I feel like I ve see maybe      of the content after a playthrough   you can murder hobo your way through   you can talk people into the weird        you can       a bear   or resurface your mommy issue   your choice matter   your combat prowess matter   idk man just play the game with friend can not go wrong
too much of soap opera    especially compare to larian s previous game   the flow of your adveture be constarntly interrupt by unnecessary drama   and then you have to get some rest in camp   because dnd      where you can have even more drama between companion   you and companion etc   after     hour I become just ompletely exhausted by it   the game isn t fun anymore   I want an adventure   not some   santa barbara   in fantasy setting
undescribable
good game
it s neat
start because of dnd   stay because of the tiefling wifey         would recommend
its a fun game
good game in the world rn
this be the bomb
incredible game
   just pull a bharv
I m pretty sure I ll change this as thing progress   I figure a lot of this be partly due to just be overwhelm   as well   to be honest   I have always         board with turn base   like big major battle and I wake up with a sore neck etc   cause I fall asleep try to figure out next step   the map traversal be way to slow for my liking at this point   like I spend     minute try to figure out how to go from the camp to anything next after that   slow maze   frustrating   I do like that jump to camp and back actually put I exactly where I be on the map
   can have sex with bear
great rpg I ve play since dragon age origin
literally   the good rpg I ve ever play
  child steal from you    confront parent    parent side with child    pick up child   throw child at parent   kill both         would throw child like projectile at parent again

I have sex with a devil    goty
you look for petite archer   busty mage   and a fearless warrior ready to bust they all down   look no far   this be your game
don t do it do not play this game   once you like it and make to the end for the first time you want to try an other class and high diffeculty diffrend race multiclass   I m on my    the run and I have     more postit for more class and idea s I wanna try out   I lose my freind its only I and my sweetheart karlach now   and pls    no more mod    
brutally honest review   it s a great game   definitely the close thing to the tabletop game as you re go to get but I think people exaggerate the review   it definitely have flaw   it s not as big as I think it would be   I expect more quest than I could handle but I now find myself struggle to find quest   I expect the ability to go through the story with a ton of quest   I ve play a lot of rpgs where there s so many quest I d need to be a completionist to do everything   for bg   though I ve spend endless hour just try to find new stuff   you have to do everything if you plan on actually match the level of the enemy as you go   I find it hard to be over level after so many hour of put the main quest aside   I expect a huge variety of armor   there s really not a lot which have be disappointing   I ve be wear the same armor for over     hour of play because I can t find any with a high armor class   the vendor be very limited and most of the time your loot be well than anything they sell   looting can often be disappointing   I ll find an interesting area guard by a ton of enemy only to find the only thing there be a trunk with a couple spell scroll      gold   armor that s not well than what I have   often common or just uncommon   some minor stuff to sell   I ll finish a whole area of enemy and when loot always find myself say   be that all        this game could be so much well   the loot system be bad   option for weapon and armor be mid   little to no variety   vendor don t restock with good weapon and gear   I ll at least justify what s good though   the choice you make be fun but often time the slight mistake can have a huge impact negatively   I feel more punish for my choice than reward   the plot though be really good   I like it a lot   the companion be awesome   they do a really good job at make likable character to where I wish I could bring they all with I lol   character creation be decent   class be fun   be this game great   absolutely   be it overwhelmingly good   in my opinion not really   maybe I just hype myself too much from hear some people say   goty   and some say it s the good game they ever play   I can definitely say I ve play well game   but it s the close thing to the tabletop rpg as you can get if you don t have friend or people to play the tabletop version with        
the plot be beautiful   the story be so well craft   the character be magnificent       hour since download and not a moment waste   and there will be many   many more to come   with new path to find and explore   thank you to larian studio for this wonderful game
insane game   I m just a bit sad I buy it only a few day ago   
hs gay sex   w

very nice
good game
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   shadowheart baby girl
great game
the game great but I m rate thumb down simply cause so much of the game lore be lock behind        coin toss base on whatever attribute you have to roll for in that moment   and if you fail the roll then you ll miss so much important side lore to character that I full on just restart my save until I hit the lore check roll lmao
as far as turn base rpgs go   I think this one be pretty pogger   the story have get some omega skibidi rizz and the character be seriously sigma   the gameplay loop be very fun   not ohio    I d give it a baby gronk      make I take my gyatt out for the rizzler  
to be honest the fight be ooutrageous
everytime gale speak I feel like I roll a nat     everything else be stellar though
  d mess with my perception

weird date sim
eh   not for I but might pick it up again some time
run pretty poorly on the steamdeck despite be verify   it be this and the combat that make I want to get a refund   I feel the combat in these sort of game be clunky and unintuitive
good game ever
I wish you would fix your freaking game larian   it s ridiculous that the elevator just move out from under shadowheart in the gauntlet of shar   be a problem for multiple patch and you still refuse to fix it     the place where it s arguably imperative to have shadowheart and this crap happen every single time   love it so much   now she s glitche behind a wall with her death save succeed and I m on honor mode   thank   wouldn t recommend this game to anyone until it s fix
for I the bg   be a step backwards after d os    as a big fan of latter   and most importantly its gameplay   bg   turn out as an unfun experience   playing on tactician I didn t get to experience a valid reproducible fighting environment   for example    I could prioritise scout battlefield in advance and have high initiative on my archer   but if the init roll be unlucky or I miss the ensnare strike   or whatever else key spell     fight go drastically different   and there s nothing I could do myself to   fix it     I don t need   also can t   to change anything else with my tactic   just have well luck   shrug     compare to d os   where you usually get more action and miss be only possible against high lvl enemy    almost everything would depend on your tactic and approach to fight   I miss that and that become a key downside of bg   for I   with gameplay miss fun part to I I notice I start avoid the fight   without the good fighting framework   I didn t feel captivate enough by the plot    it would be unfair to not mention good thing in bg   compare to other game base on dnd   game I often don t like      ilitthid power as a way to get out of constraint of dnd framework and provide some extra power   I find this to be a very smart move    turn base system    gear variety and option be quite rich   you be not look for high weapon enchantment only   I d say it s a good dnd game   but bad larian game    with all that    I be happy for the game be a huge financial success and look forward to future game from larian
cool game     
stick in update again   I just want to play the game   it be so much well before all these game launcher and update become mandatory
its cool and the combat be fun   but the amount of bug steer I away from be able to enjoy it
still no crossplay

first of all it be a pretty good game but I feel like its way over hype and over rate   I have lot of prior experience with d d and it doesn t really scratch that itch   I be hope for more video game equivalent of   th edition but it s not quite there   I get tired of the narrator s voice and I really didn t like most of the party companion much   everyone want to sleep with the main character even though it seem like they hate they half the time make no sense   I m sure a lot have change since I ve play it   what I be hope for be   not just an open world experience   but one with more freedom and not such a locked in story   a railroaded story line as d d player might call it    it s just not as fun as I think it would be and by the time I sample enough of the game to know that   I d play too much to refund   and yeah I do try to   for previous balder s gate player   it s essentially bg in name only   when I play it seem there be a lack of side quest and the world feel kinda small   every playthrough will be similar and there s no random event encounter to my knowledge
just start into the game   I be shock by the lack of freedom during the character creation   for a aaa game   it s appal that there be only      body type per gender and that your body dimension and ratio be set with the click on one button   the face almost all look    off   I can t describe it   I feel unable to create a character that I like visually   inclusiveness be fine   but here it feel like replace iveness   I see well character option in game        year ago   yes   I m old     apart from that   the game be good   I still keep this review negative because I consider the char editor an insult and disgrace to the gaming community
I have    massive problem with the game   the companion and the combat    I consider companion character a very important aspect of rpgs like this   they can range from be amazing and make the game much well   such as in dragon age origin    or they can be simply good and boost the game moderately   such as in divinity original sin      but in this game   I just can not get myself to like they   most of they feel like overexaggerated stereotype   and they don t even seem consistent in their writing   since a companion act like they re against something   and when I make a decision in game that I expect they to dislike base on what they tell I   I get a    companion   approve    most of the interaction I ve have with they   and the interaction they ve have between each other   just feel very flat and I find it very difficult to invest myself into these character   even though that s something I love to do in every rpg where it s possible    as for the combat   it s strange   it feel like they take divinity original sin    s combat and try to merge it with the old baldur s gate game   combat   which may not sound terrible on paper   but I don t really like the outcome   everything be turn base and pause after you do your thing   which be great in do    but now you only get    action and    bonus action per turn   in do    you could have as many action as you have action point per turn   and you could strategize on wether to keep the action point until your next turn   or do as much as possible in the current turn   here   you can just do    or    thing per turn and that s it   it make the combat slow and remove a large part of strategizing that do   have   speak of strategize   it s mostly non existent in this game due to the main combat mechanic   rng   it doesn t matter how good the tactic you ve choose be   how good your equipment or your stat be   because at the end of the day   everything be decide by a dice and it be only affect by your stat and equipment   in other word   you can be overpower on paper   but when you re in combat   you can be completely usesless when the rng decide you will miss every hit   this mechanic be fine in a tabletop game where combat be quite simple and small scale   but bg   have considerably large scale battlefield with a large number of combatant   this mean you can fight through a horde of enemy and then lose simply   because you couldn t get a good number roll on the last enemy   the only way to prevent this from happen be to keep quick saving and reload when necessary   which people call   save scumming    but I honestly don t have the patience to keep do that    tldr   companion be not enjoyable when compare to previous great rpgs and interaction with they feel inorganic   the combat have remove the aspect of strategy present in do   and everything run on a random number generator   I really try to get into the game and I would like to continue try   but I just don t think I can muster up any more interest this game   I m glad other people enjoy this game   I just wish I could ve enjoy it too
I try to be interested but after     hour I have to uninstall   if you prefer an interactive movie with emphasis on dialogue and cutscene you may find entertainment   but if gameplay be what you re after   keep look
feel more like a date sim then a dnd game
this aaa game have be out for over a year and the main menu do not work   I can not access the setting or even start a new game   I have no word   other than   thank the god for steam s refund policy
game be glitchy compare to the developer previous game   divinity     which I really like    not a fan of the world building or some of the dialogue
slow   dull combat from larian yet   I don t care about wait for a dozen enemy to fully animate their turn   it s garbage   skip it and let I play a game
do not like that my character have no voice   the narrator get tiresome and the fighting be blah   much prefer the fighting in dragonage inquisition to bg    wish there be a refund option available  
    third party launcher with account request   it can be bypass but be an unnecessary annoyance       cutscene can t be pause       audio level be awful   dialogue level be much low than other sound   which be already quite low with all setting maxe   not be able to hear the dialogue be a dealbreaker for I   this have apparently go unacknowledged by the developer since launch
I ve really want to like this game   I ll invest a few day into it   get frustrated   take a break   and then force myself to come back for another try   each time I come back   I leave all the same   but perhaps with more bitterness than before    I don t know what it be exactly   but as someone who play soul game   and platinum ed bloodborne   I be fimiliar with frustrating and difficult game   but this one be different   I even put hundred of hour in x com      which be a fantastic balance between difficult strategy and luck   there seem to be too many rng element that even though you try to prepare for battle with buff and gain high ground etc    ultimately it just come down to a dice roll   you can do everything right and roll a    and you re absolutely f   ke   I hate this so much    the game be waaay too punish   even on balanced    especially for a story drive game   which btw have some of the good dialogue ever in game history   but as someone who actually enjoy combat in game   I actually dread it in this game because it s just so cumbersome and long wind    I really want to progress through the story as I know how rich it be   but I literally can t   it s so frustrating to not be able to play a game you want to play
I ve never be into d d   nor magic and well   weird stuff   and guess what   I m still not    d d might have be a big thing before video game   understandably   but I be convinced anyone enjoy this   gush out their excited review   be an old fart gamer try to recreate their childhood as they sit at home   alone   decade on    I be surprised I even manage     hour before shelve this   I think it be stupid to spend all my time click vaguely all over the screen   hope something exciting might happen   when a dice roll be large than the number need be as exciting as it get   it fall quite quickly into the   I m not interested in what this be mean to be   department    but ok   I get it   game have good review so it s obviously something I should not have try    if you re a city management builder    rd person   explorer kind of person   forget it   it s an annoyingly simple minded clickfest with   supposedly exciting   cause and effect variation that you only find out about later   necessitate another playthrough   if you can be bother    visually interesting initially   I be intrigue to see what would happen but that soon disappear into another   oh look   another random fight with a random creature yield a random result     at your first savescum   bale   it win t get any well       
it would be well without the gay liberal     
not mac freindly
turn base   far view   not what I think base on advertisement
not gay enough
great game   buggy unoptimized mess   do bethesda make a dnd game     
of course it s not a bad game   I just want to say that the developer should think more about fix bug   improve the combat system   the economy     I wish they would try to improve the gameplay   not think about how to       every damn character in the game   please
wow   these guy be even well than bethesda   incredible skill to develop the same game for the   rd time in a row on an outdated engine   I be especially pleased that      of the dialogue   book and note be write as if by a ml   I always advocate for progress   I guess I spend too much time dig loot chest   which be probably why the game feel so deep to I   I like the innovative solution in combat issue   throw dozen of weak opponent on you into a turn base game feel like genius   now I can go to work between round   it s wonderful that the developer didn t complicate the gameplay by implement an excessive character editor   everything ingenious be invent before we   why complicate it if you can take the editor from morrowind   I think it s a big plus that the world doesn t change in any way with the time spend in it   it s good that we can t go back after complete act and see the result of our action   the world around we should seem like a stage with plywood decoration   then you don t risk succumb to escapism and lose touch with reality   the developer   muse tell they that it be important to have time to implement only     of the     character level   already at the beginning of the   rd act   your character reach the maximum level and   more than a third of the game   you no long need to bother with such a tedious thing as level up   it s amazing that literally every chest in the game can be search   what s especially brilliant be that more than half of they don t have a random loot flag   make they literally always empty   their existence seem pointless   but we all know that every extra minute spend in this game do such thing be priceless   it s incredible that in       there be still company add junk item and completely ignore the idea of visual language to help convey the value of the item       non stackable pig head        gb of uncompressed content of       quality   impressive rendering range from oblivion   while you wait for the download   you can manage to launch cyberpunk from scratch      fps on rtx      ti in the city center   of course   all this leave no choice but to play       hour           game of the year    without sarcasm   this be the good implementation of a typical d d company in the game   but too average rpg   I think that the game receive too much hype   and the developer do not receive the necessary criticism to at least fix the inherent problem for the fourth time   mod manager from the last update be disgusting   it already work bad than instal mod through nexus   bug be not fix   it feel like there be only more of they

game will not load on my imac   I upgrade ram to     gig ddr        ghz at     v    run every update restart redownloade try to get this game to work for my wife and I   it just will not work and I be about to ask for my money back if possible I m piss about this the website say it would work with my computer
I ve be play the bg series since the beginning   all of the variant of this game style as well    this game be so promising   trap   and the actual problem behind it   the inability to pause while walk around   absolutely ruin my possible enjoyment of this game    the trap simply ruin it   outright   full stop      year of rpg video game begin design and larian continue to hold to an archaic and foolish   challenge   of not have pause in a game that be otherwise turn base   I ve wipe several time simply because trap   exist   and you be force to go into a   turn base   exploration mode   skip through three character turn each time just to get to your trap disarm character again     and heaven help you if you forgot to turn off the party ai group everyone together   even then   the trap disarmer will often set the trap off while walk to it to disarm it    absurd   inexcusable   if I hadn t have life prevent I from play for month   I d have refund what should have be a magnum opus   instead   I m leave with disappointment because exploration in an rpg be punish in a way that feel wholly unfair    a simple   auto pause on trap sight or trigger   and good game ever    in it s current   and forever   state   I can t even recommend this to my cat
no

I really try to enjoy this game but all the gay stuff spoil it for I   sorry to anyone offend
no thank
total          slow ass racist gameplay
if you play and value game for strictly gameplay then it s a        but if you re not a woke freak then that will ruin the game for you    I try play the game to ignore the cringe wake stuff   but in the goblin part with the   absolute   I have to take out the goblin leader   good game   but I also have to deal with all this childish and cringe anti christian b   sh t    I lose my willpower eventually and stop play   my hour be on the top
one of the bad rpgs I have try in past     year    this combat system probably work on pnp but it s really awkward and slow on pc   it s so sad that old baldur s gate and nwn get it right and bg   feel like go back to step      multiplayer experience be definitely even bad   combat become a meme where everyone just play drum after every single turn or do something else pointless just because they have extra action to spare    big part of the marketed play time probably come from unskippable fullscreen dice roll    tl dr   feel like devs spend more time design different genitalia option than actually build enjoyable gameplay
this be not d d    no rolling stat which be foundational to d d   can t choose to lower stat on purpose for role play sake   only include the wet dream class of the devs instead of the promise phb   shove into high level play with thing you shouldn t know about for at minimum second tier play   not even faithful to basic   e rule    play for hour before get out of tutorial railroading   still haven t leave the rail    not convince it exist    vampire as team mate    this isn t twilight    the absolute bad user interface I ve ever encounter in any game   complete jank    low level enemy far out equip you and somehow automatically know the position of all your chaacter   enemy auto detect your hide character completely behind full cover and can magicallyshoot through wall but you have to be within range for enemy to close to melee when you use range combat   you be force into environmental effect if you just click attack instead of micromanage your movement      and much more   it be a garbage game with pretty graphic   I buy it   I ll attempt to find a way to enjoy it   but it be bottom of the barrel   even though they spend year   develop   it    baldur s gate and baldur s gate    be lightyear well
terrible      word can not describe how horrible the beginning of this game be     I ve play every other game there be or have be ever and finally come to purchase this during the sale hope it would be baldur gate but instead if just a cheap ugly aggravating piece of garbage where you start in the anus of a beast from another world control by mindflayer try to free someone who didn t get magically release from their capsule like you do and you have to wonder around look for something to put in a hole to free she    be you kid I this if your beginning to baldur s gate      you can not really interact with anything and the thing you can interact with be either useless and do nothing or they explode and kill you in the first   min after finally get through all the crappy bloated cut scene I m sure be design to waste everyone s first two hour   like wtf so stupid everything even the pathing its so horrible I think my first    dude and the little ugly mind pet that join you run back and forth around target getting hit instead of actually attack they   the camera be horrible and so difficult to control I can t understand how this game be so popular be so expensive and start off so horribly and with most everything you do break useless or pointless just one big giant waste of time   refund probably win t ever try it again definitely not at that price
I will continue to post negative review until steam figure out what the meaning of consent be and let I tell the request for review to       off forever because I m just not go to leave serious review   ever   it s just not a thing I m go to do so kindly get that part of the ui the entire       out of my face   thank

the good dnd experience I ve have in game without a real dm   great story telling and game play
a genuine experience I wish I could relive fully again
not good enough   waist a lot of time for a little experience
good game ever  
great game
absolutely horrible game there aren t any lootboxe or battlepasse or in game purchase or skin but if they add competitive matchmaking I think I will consider give this game another try however until then I would not recommend this game to anybody that isn t a virgin cuck
this game be bad   basically you re not try to provoke a fight or go in anywhere   in ruin or cave   because you know that a fight could break out   that s why you don t do anything   because otherwise you would die   I don t even know why I didn t return this game    I go into a cave that be hide behind first base   there you can see    goblin   so the fight would be easy if you surprise they   the problem be that some stone be spit fire that you can t turn off and you immediately lose half of your life point and die    the other situation be in a ruin where I use a lever and there be        banintite behind this door shoot one directly with arrow   I might have be able to do that too if they hadn t start first   die again   basically you have to die your way through until you resolve any situation   I play on the easy difficulty level   maybe the game be good if you save every        minute   these be area in the game that I didn t explore because they seem too dangerous or I die because of the situation   the stone that breathe fire be in the cave with    goblin    every npc you see be a threat   so you don t speak at all and try to go a different way   the game be basically that you don t do anything otherwise you die   at least I think that with the easy setting the game would be halfway good   but so far I ve die once with every fight   you have to look into the future in this game so that you can solve it halfway
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   play turn base game be so gay imo   I couldn t bring myself play more than    hour and refund   it s not for everyone   certainly not for I   at least I couldn t care less about baldur s gate universe and its game
I m a newcomer to the d d universe   but this game intuitively help player like I to learn rapidly and play as enjoyably as possible   baldur s gate    be superb and one of a kind   I could almost lose my perception of real world time and space during gameplay
good game I ve ever play
gud game   very gud game
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
fun and immersive   not exactly dnd but a great combat system   I be suck in from the start and the game only get well as it go on   definitely re playable too
the good game there be
very fun   detailed rpg   as a dnd fan I especially appreciate how it integrate a table top experience with video gaming
good game ever
I spend      hour romance one vampire twink and it make I bawl my eye out in the end         would recommend
as a wise psychopath once say    its perfect   perfect   down to the last minute detail    so many choice to be make   either be a hero full of hope and justice   bring happiness in the dark of corner   help every unfortunate soul   and love be everywhere   and also very cool character and story be find even behind stone d   or just be a very         up person and destroy everything and be ready to kill every single living being in the game                       massive bonus point for karlach  
baldur s gate    doesn t just pull you in   it practically kidnap you   every decision feel like walk a tightrope   and you will mess up    but that s half the fun   the game s chaos be where the magic lie   and it s never   game over    it s   how do I end up in this mess     the companion   they re absolute wildcard   each with more emotional baggage than an airliner   and it make they unforgettable   and the dice roll   addictive   success feel like a win   and failure be the good kind of mayhem    final score   a natural      play it
good game
tis good tune   good character   tis be good
bear simulator  
pretty neat game   goone to shadowheart a few time
make crpg great again    master piece

awesome game   so many hour of gameplay with such rich attention to detail   this game be an achievement to behold   highly recommend   just be aware   that rate m mean something this time   just as how anime suddenly become sus when your parent walk in   maybe avoid play part of this game around other lol
        need no other review
I love this game   also I have not ever beat the game but I be on my   th tav
I have a midterm tommorow but baldur gate take priority   no one will remember what I get on that midterm but everyone will remember how I defeat the absolute
oh   y god this game so goo d
there be a reason why this game get game of the year
if d d fit your schedule
accidentally boinke a horrific lovecraftian tentacle monster       
top    game of all time
I be not the big fan of game with this layout   but   with the use of the wasd mod   and the crazy good story line   I be fine with it   I really would recommend this game to everyone who be on the line about it   it be enjoyable and the whole game be just captivate   I have always want to play dnd   but I could never seem to find the right crowd   I feel like this game be very similar
alright   fellow dice roller and chaotic adventurer   let I take you on a journey through one of the most enchanting   life consume experience that exist outside the realm of reality   baldur s gate     if you ve ever want to know what it s like to live in a d d world   buckle up    this be the game that deliver on every front
so   so   much to do       hour and I still haven t beat the main quest once
awesome game
this be my favorite game
  thank for the recommendation twitter   and good       larian       
lengdary game      star
too addictive
it s varied and fulfilling but so very long   my only real gripe in this game be that you can accidentally lock yourself out of certain dialogue and romance option by do chapter   out of order   without a clear indication of what the correct order be or which companion to bring with you to experience they
probably the good and most interactive turn base game around if not ever   love how every choice you make in dialogue or in the middle of combat can drastically alter the story and the ending you receive   I would highly recommend this game to any strategy style game lover

love this game   this be about to be only the second video game I ve ever play to the finish   hade be the first    it s never that I don t like play game   but that I get bored and bogge down eventually   bg   keep thing interesting   and spicy    at every turn and I love the side quest available everywhere you go   plenty of bobble and treasure to investigate for a loot        like I   I win t just be finish this game   I ll be start it over again soon to try an evil play through   it s that good      there be one or two game mechanic that don t really make sense   for instance   there s no real market for gem stone or fine jewelry other than sell they in lieu of gold   and I really wish that you have a tent in camp that you decorate with cool stuff you find   like skull or painting   or whatever   so the item have a use and the player could have some fun with it   also   act iii definitely have the most bug   which make sense   because you debug as you go   and the number of player filter off the further you get in any game    but it be still frustrating because act I and ii be so much smoother by comparison   I have hope larian will keep fix and smooth it out though   great game overall

bro   this be so fein   
it s fun
perfect rpg   that s baulder gate should be
my job come between my baldur s gate playthrough         would quit again
well rpg since witcher  
fun continuation of the baulder s gate franchise   interesting start    only    hrs into it   so a long way to go
I play a lot of different game since     year now   and I never play anything like baldur s gate        everything be beautiful and elaborate   the world   just a single room with nothing much to do inside be already super detailed   a broken window be just an invitation to explore   nothing be leave randomly    all character   playable or not have deep interaction that can lead to so many different outcome that make you feel really actor of the game   you want to hear everything everybody have to say and really think about your answer and what how you see your journey    music be just so good too of course     without mention all the gameplay itself with all race and class mix possible      larian studio   thank you and gg
fun game   great story
yes
just wow
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   game of the all time
yes
turned base be not my typical type of game to play but once I give this one a fair try I quickly see why baldur gate    be declare game of the year       hour on my first run through   about to see how a dark urge run fair now
after play a good amount you start to see the flaw   dislike some of the writing for certain character but overall really enjoy character building and game mechanic   beat this game for the first time be one of the good time I ve have
it s fun   there be a few quirk that can be a tad annoying but otherwise an engaging game
one of the good rpgs ever make
the only thing I can say be this game run a bit slow on my m   max laptop
I ve love all of the baldur s gate game   this one didn t disappoint   the character the story and the gameplay be all top notch
good game
  st time to play a d d game       hook      recommend strongly
awesome
goty
wonderful   amazing game solo and even more amazing with a friend or two    story can be whatever you make it to be   want an edgy tale of evil character try to be well people   want to play your classic good vs evil   want to be more evil than the evil villain   want a total meme run of love and peace   all can be do and more    honestly   tabletop be still tabletop but this comes really flip close to replicate the range in storytelle atmosphere player agency etc     also   ranger be actually good in bg   and you   do not   need homebrew rule to make ranger feel competitive in this   that and wizard of the coast can suck it   new   e change kinda suck and the water down lore of new   e be total garbage   thank you larian for immortalize good   e rule    with some need balancing change    and create a truly wonderful story game   I wish you all the good with divinity    and any other project you put your mind to   truly   this be one of the good game I have ever play and certainly one of the good I ever will play   its be a privilege and an honor  
funny pale elf

help
imo dnd just make this game bad     random f for no reason
I like it a lot   the girl and guy be really cute c
good game
good game I really recommend complete the first game with friend in     hour of play time during    year and    month   and complete the game after reach      hour in game   the same happen with divinity    xd
I know I be late to the party but damnn   this game be consume my day   before I know it I have play for    hour straight again   the combination of   story combat   be perfect   and even though this be my first playthrough I already know the replayability   the control be suprisingly easy to learn and before you know it you understand how it work   in this day and age   I can also really appreciate a game without a thousand dlc s or in game purchase   in short this be the game I didn t know I need   
I m late to this game but agree that it be a love letter d d fan   great game play   voice act   and design   it have some element some might not like but nothing over the top or lore break that I find in my play through so far   a must have
a happy accident   I and my friend have just go to camp look to long rest   after a having deal with some enemy   before we long rest   would be be party s most soul crush moment in be campaign   two friend have begin to fight each other for fun   when scratch be amazing cute fluffy dog have approach   be druid proceed to cast call lightning   a spell in which scratch be catch in the crossfire and immediately drop to the ground his now fluffy body   be ash   with no way to revive he we hold the great funeral   fill with laugh   and panic as to how we fix this issue   alas there be no way to save scratch   
one of my favorite game ever
amazing tbc game   highly recommend to d d fan
this be my most favorite game   always help I feel well whenever I be feel down
its a pretty small game   but I like it   its mostly about three guy and a squid
I ve play this game in its entirety on ps   prior to own it on steam   multiple time   bg   be my personal goat
            
this game be a banger

I m usually not very into rpg but this game be amazing   when I start play   I can t stop myself from play all day and night   the story be compelling   the game play be very fun   and there be so much to do   definitely my favorite game on steam
     
   if you like d d then you might like this I don t know
good gamer
       if you speed up combat     x
jnkbuyjkuyjkuky hgcvthrtsert
love it
amazing game
one of my favorite game of all time
       would smite everything again
look   just look at video of the game do take my word for it   but yes   it be a game I have waste over     k hour on even if steam say its only    
do not know if I would like it at first since I do not like turn base combat   well worth the       hell i d pay       for it         game
the good game I ve play in a long time   the story be amazing I m obsess            
when do act    end
amazing game play   I love the old turn base rpgs and this be like one of those oldie but with way well graphic and game mechanic
fun game   great story   excellent strategy gameplay   worth every dollar
I love this game please play it   I m review this for a steam achievement lol
the well date simulator of     
gate of baldur   rd
my favorite game this decade   and possibly of all time
there be few game I bother replay and few still where I bother get all achievement   I have complete multiple run of this game and even after get the last achievement I still want to play more of it   the world   music   write   gameplay   design    all superb
the amount of content be just amazing   now combine this with all the branching path   new character run   role play option   and you can easily spend hundred of hour and never see the final act   go be the fetch quest that make so many rpg s a chore   the side quest be interesting and the more you explore the more you be bind to find stuff you miss   simply put   you can not just do one play through both because of design and a desire to see what could of happen   that be say     there be some bug and story element that can become convoluted due to your action or random outcome   overall its an amazing adventure that will keep you entertain for a long time   this be of course not even include multiplayer   my only two gripe have be learn to hit f   to save often due to the nature some combat mechanic not be readily apparent and larian not commit to an expansion   what a game
game be dope   you already know that
great game with lot of curious route to take
mommy milker
awesome game   so much to do   so much to find   so much to fall in love with   for sure go to play it again with a different character   nothing more than love for this game  
good game ever   so much to explore   I love the story   the way decision affect everything   and overall   after over      hour   I still love to explore   I recommend this game to everyone   and it s worth every penny
this be a great game for anyone who   like I   have always want to know more about d d but never have time or chance   the gameplay be smooth enough for rpger to transition to the d d world   two thumb up
one of the good game I ve ever play
this game be such a unique and engaging experience   I literally can t stop play   it s basically d d in digital form   with so many character design option   fun and engage quest and puzzle   and a lot of companion to adventure with   the only problem be that for a   a game that s win so many award and have already be out for a year now   it have a lot of unsolved bug   but hey   nobody s perfect
   rat ask I help because someone break one of his tooth    get in a food storage room    find the person who do this to rat friend    its a paralyzed lady guard the food of the camp    rat want I to kill she    try to kill she    get in the jail       escape    kill the paralyzed lady    rat friend happy   d   would recommend      
""
peak
good game especially if you like dnd
one of the good rpgs ever and something which captivate I truly after dragon age origin
a standard the hater can not stand up to
I like the flaming girlfriend
first time play turn base at this level   my hour be a honest reflection to my opinion of bg    well do larian
""
when someone ask I which game be one of the good in my life   I ll say baldur s gate        p s   the only thing miss be a romanceable goblin girl    I guess no game be flawless   
as cell say to gohan when he first witness ss        incredible  
fun   no note   add mod be fun and I bang a goth chick   life be complete
it s pretty good   yeah   I ve only have it download for less than two day   why do you ask
well rpg I ve ever play   and easily one of my favorite game of all time   all my hour be on playstation   I only buy it on steam for multiplayer   but I just have to write this review   get it  
squid sex
I absolutely love this game   the plot be amazing   the turn base combat work really well   and the npc s be flesh out so well
you can bottom for ursus spelaeus but can t top a goblin     this vexe I               
it s alright
its almost too good
excellent game with multiple path and story line for countless play both good and evil   play solo or with a group and have the same amount of fun   however I would not recommend this game for spoiled   petulant   brat   the incessant whining will very quickly grow tiresome
if the many award and acclaim this game have earn haven t already convince you then let I give it one last try   this game be a grand adventure in the forget realm of the dungeon and dragon universe   every choice you make have consequence   gather your party and choose your path will you save those in need or doom they to their fate   or bad hasten it s arrival
every new gameplay be different   make it lot of fun
you get to keep a dog in your camp   what more do you need
stupid amount of fun alone or with friend
master piece
neat game   a little linear   but that s to be expect   wish there be a bit more of a sandbox feel
I lose    month of my life to this game       
so          fun
goat status
finally get to finish this one   pretty good game   an awful lot of glitchy or unfinished content   definitely a long grind but should be pretty replayable as character vary largely on internal motivation and there be many way to approach individual encounter   behind the core gameplay be a very good   replayable game which I d recommend get once it s on sale for     
great game   very polished with lot of great story line   the pacing can be a bit slow sometimes   but that s just the nature of a turn base rpg   the nice thing be that you can also play the game in short burst without lose anything
good game   ever     
pretty good
it as close to actual d d that I have see in any d d video game I have play   and that include the super old school one
I love it
great game
d
fun   so many choice
the hype be in fact well deserved   play it   you win t regret it
I love form emotional bond with pixel          would recommend if you have     s of hour to sit and click your mouse   the game doesn t rely on online guide supper often and most everything can be find achieve just by look closely and examine everything
as a very new player to baldur s gate but also someone that be well verse in turn base rpg   there be a bit of a learn curve but once it make sense to I it open up so incredibly and have be a very gratifying experience   very much recommend especially if it be an unfamiliar type of gameplay   grow to understand it be so gratifying
this be one of the good rpg s ever make   if you like fantasy or dungeon and dragon in any capacity you have to play this game
I do it with a space octopus
I cry      what a masterpiece this be
one of the good game I have ever play
goate ass game
I love divinity original sin    by load screen studio   pcgamer s     pc game of all time
very fun
what else be there to say about this game   it be a masterpiece rpg    the character   the voice act   the environment   the combat   the graphic   everything be superb   larian studio go above and beyond in what be clearly a passion project for they and make one of the good game of all time   if you love rpg s you will love this game   if you have never try one this would be the good way to introduce yourself to the genre           a score I use very   very sparingly
this be make by larian studio     shall I say more   also   this be the good voice act around   you could watch it as a movie and enjoy it    this be a great game for anybody that be relatively new to gaming    enjoy
I purchase this game over a year ago and just couldn t get into it   I m not a fan of dnd turn style   click to move   or ton of dialogue   base on all the glowing review I think I could get over it   I try for several hour and walk away   I come back a year later and give it another go after try dragon age veilguard and be severely disappoint with that game    after put more time into it it really grow on I   almost every npc have something interesting to say   a random character that seem like filler can lead to hour of quest   the complexity of the story and action you can take be astounding   the romance option with your group member   which I think be silly at first   really have I care and think about they even after put the game down   the voice act be perfect   nothing over the top   just sincere and colorful    I ve only just defeat one of the first main boss and it seem like there s still many more hour worth of gameplay   and you could play this over and over again and have the story go so many different direction
this game will ruin all other crpgs for you   every other game will pale in comparison from the sheer combat gameplay freedom
good game ever
game of this caliber only come around once every decade or two
this game be just goat d    idk how else to put it
great story and so many fun little hide thing to explore
it be verpt with a bear
genre defining game   imo
hot wizard
have a blast play with my friend for the span of a year   just wish when play    player   the companion act like they re with you the entire time   because we miss out on romance and stuff because our party be too full to equip member to proceed their story line
this be lidduhlee the good game I ve play since rdr   and tlou    the voice act be fantastic   cinematic be great   I love the amount of importance your choice make   and the combat be slightly confusing but very polished   worth a freaking play and god bless you all and stay safe

extremely fun so far
well rpg out there right now   I prefer the combat of divinity     but there s nothing like the presentation in bg    if you be one of the three people that haven t try this game yet I highly recommend it
I never know what baldur s gate    be or why it win goty last year    after      hour   I m already plan    different playthrough   I m on my second one right now after beat it for the first time    you win t see a game like this for another decade   play it    ps   don t buy that new dragon age        ass
I quite like this game   I really appreciate the character though   divinity    s character be rather bland and inoffensive   like most other crpg s I have play   these character be all unique and extremely fun   they have realistic trauma heighten into slightly silly fantasy   but the human core of they be still so raw   I find myself empathize with they even though I have be spoil on some of their ending    if you be on the fence   it be very much worth a try   it be just as good as you have hear   if not well
very good
just start play   gameplay be amazing and immersive   the soundtrack be an absolute eargasm   remind a little bit of the lord of the ring movie soundtrack   the game be worth the price for sure
must play
an absolutely amazing game    
be good
the only negative be it make enjoy everything else less

this game be objectively fantastic   as long as you enjoy the modern dnd combat system   I be talk turn base   and overall the dnd combat system   the dnd combat system be artistically and perfectly open   a significant upgrade to the divinity    original sin    s combat system   if you can articulate the amazing combat   there be so much good to be find and have   otherwise   this game be perfect and come with all of the positive of a turn base game
I m only like     hour in so far but wow   this be a wonderful video game   my first baldur s gate game   first d d anything   play divinity original sin    and that s a great game as well   larion just have it s finger on the pulse of this top down rpg style   they be the master of character and quest design   seriously every companion you can get in this game be so fleshed out and they feel like real people   getting use to the d d mechanic take some time but I do get use to it   I feel like I ve barely scratch the surface of this game but it s easy to recommend   there hasn t be an aspect of this game that I haven t enjoy   just play it and keep play it until you don t want to stop play it
my work life be get in the way of baulder gate time
I have yet to make it to act     this game be an alt addict worst nightmare   
peak
this game be really fun and interesting I def recommend it to any dnd fan
there be so many different way to play this game that it never get boring   it s the first game in a long time that s worth every single penny
peak
if you like d d   what s not to like   just start and its already really fun
this game be amazing whether you like this type of game before this game will make you love it nonetheless fairly easy to get into and you can just quite literally do anything there be you can move one ass rock and will probably start an encounter so        it may get repetitive after       playthrough   
baldur s gate    be a groundbreaking rpg that set a new standard for storytelle   player choice   and immersion   every choice feel impactful   the character be unforgettable   and the world be rich with detail and freedom   with stunning visual   deep tactical combat   and countless way to approach each situation   it s an absolute must play for any rpg fan   a true masterpiece

good game I ve ever play
rightful winner of all the award it receive   game be good
good game for couple in my entire life
this game have an amazing story line   it be so easy to get lose in this game and for hour to just pass by   the character creation be great   and the character in game be even well   I be so glad I start play this game   though now I have a small obsession   haha
extremely deep rpg with absurd amount of possibility   remind I of skyrim back in       where my friend have go to completely different place than I that it sound like we be play a different game    the only downside be the learning how to play it   even though the game make the most effort to teach you about it s system   you will end up look at youtube guide   that s just the nature of such a complex game   once you get a hold of this game open to you and fun never stop

karlach hot
nothing I can say will properly convey what this game have do to I   I m not even do with the game
the good
very cool
this game be absolutely amazing I be only     hour in but this game be get to be the good game I have ever play   everything be amazing from the background music   visual   animation   dialogue and story    if you re think about buy baldur s gate    just do it   especially if you be into d d and fantasy stuff
I have not be this addicted to a game since elden ring   it really be a fantastic   immersive and overall excellent experience        recommend if you like any type of rpg s
the most rich and detailed rpg know to man   great replay ability
ridiculously addicted to this game   so much content   awesome mod capability   beautiful graphic   and the character interaction be spectacular   worth every cent
its okay ig
at first it didn t really click with I    but now    it s so so so much fun
the good game I have ever play   by a mile
story line be incredible   I be very pleased with the outcome of this game
it s one of the good game to have come out in recent year
it s a good game   you can tell the developer put a lot of time and passion into the game   and continue to update it
great game
gaem good   very fun       
fun game   well think out
""
    h in and must say I like the game   it s a bit hard sometimes but it s fun   and with a bf that play dnd and have play this game before I I get a lot of tip and trick
guud
so far it s live up to the hype   I love it   
top    game of all time for sure
take I    save to get into this game   but it be well worth it   never play d d before and have no idea what to expect but   as an rpg lover   this be probably the good game I ve ever play
I really struggle with this game at first   I d never play anything like this or anything to do with dnd   it take I quite a few attempt to get into the game and I keep remake character   there s a point where it just click   if you re think about buy it   just buy it   I m      hour in and only just finish my first ever run through
a true rpg game   there s so much to do and so many possibility to do say thing   it s crazy   I ve play over      hour and there s still stuff to discover   you have almost full control of your outcome   which be amazing   love it   
an amazing and huge rpg with lot of content and unique interaction base on the class race etc   you play and the option you choose to take    the combat be turn base and can be challenge in a first playthrough but never unfair    the character cast be great and diverse with many different individual story and vary outcome depend on you    the dialogue be well write and the overarching story be good while the many many optional quest give you the feeling of a true adventure    take about      hour to complete on a first try if you do everything optional as well but it also offer replayability with its many different path
 
good graphic   good story   just a bit too much complicated control system for my taste   otherwise perfect choice to play
one of the good rpgs ever make
I kinda suck at this game     but its amazing how different each play through can be      depend on your race   class and how mean you want to be

amazing game   amazing story   the only downside be the turn base combat
take drug        a bear
fantastic   I absolutely love this game and high recommend this game to any rpg pr ttrpg nerd out there
word can hardly express how much I love this game   larian studio have do what bioware couldn t    create a game as compelling as dragon age   origin and take it to the next level   the dialogue   storyline   music   atmosphere and character be all so captivate that they take you on a journey to another world and make you genuinely care about what happen    I haven t feel this immerse in a game in year   this be a journey you ll want to experience for yourself   and honestly   it s the good gift you could give to someone    also         would bang a squid again    
     hour spend beat this game and the hard part be accept its over
this be already my favorite thing ever and I ve only play around    hour so far
good game
instantly addict
shadowheart have a nice rack
never play d d before   have lot of discussion prior to buying and have not be disappoint yet
if you can t already tell   I love this game   definitely worth    
one of the good
first review I ve ever ever felt compel to post a review on steam and with good reason   for context   my favorite game before play baldur s gate    be the witcher     and if you love that game   you will absolutely love this game too    I have never play a game with so many choice and outcome   such intricately flesh out dialogue   and fun   diverse character build   so much so that I start a new play through immediately after finish the first one    the first play through take I roughly     hour or so   try to       the entire game   complete every quest I could manage to find while explore all map   now I be go at it again with the dark urge origin   and I have no doubt it will be just as phenomenal of an experience as the first time   highly recommend for anyone who love rpgs
I hesitate only because the game play seem like something I wouldn t like   I couldn t have be more wrong   this game be a new classic   they ve make multiple game in one by allow you to play and replay it through the eye of multiple origin character   or your own   larian studio   with one game   have become the kind of company I will watch for announcement and new release   I can not emphasize how satisfied I be with this game and the studio   the in game mod manager have breathe eternal life into this game in a way no other studio have have the nerve to do   the only dissatisfaction larian have bring to their community come in confession of cut rewrite content and their decision to end the series with bg    I promise you    overwhelmingly positive   do give enough credit to this game
good game of not just        but all time
most immmersive rpg experience everrr   especially with mod
what can I say   its a          good game
this be a great game   it tough in place that just mean you need to level up your character   its d d as a video game   they put a lot of effort into the story   I m love it
my d drive explode   good game
this be a phenomenal game   really worth the money
game good
       on console         on pc
perfection in a game   nothing less
absolutely love this game   I love it so much I literally almost cry at the end   not because I be sad of the ending but because I know deep down it be my last   first   time beat such an amazing game and I could never get that feeling ever again     highly recommend
one of the good game I ve ever play   it have so much playtime   and many diffrent path and class to choose
noodz
properly play your first new game will give you your roi
barely play it   it be alright I guess
good   game   ever
yay
goblin   
shart   
fun
its really fun
recommend
just like the good ol   day   great game
the goat
goat game
you can not fake quality like you can not fake a good meal    good game ever
the good game in a decade
get lose on the sword coast only to find who you really be
I like it
one of the good and unique gaming experience I ve have in my life   the attention to detail and craftsmanship be incredible   game of the decade
probably the good game I ve ever play   it s not only a fun strategy game that allow you to cause a ton of chaos and mischief   but an incredibly well write rpg that will lead you down so many path and leave you replay the game for an eternity
more then     h play   but not in steam   I usually don t like turn base game   actually I hate they   but this one be great   one of the good game I ve ever play
funny dnd game
fun game good time sink
dnd but on a computer and well story
yes
perfection
 
excellent iteration of d d    well execute   write   draw etc excellent voice act   dialog and combat   with a wide selection to personalise your an your follow game style combat style and narrative arc   equally as easy to control with mouse or controller   something that require clever implementation and for I the ability to pick up the game where I leave off without have to dread either mouse or controller make a big difference   desktop   steam deck   laptop   pc handheld   console   mac eg    at this point have keep I entertain for      s of hour
why would not I   you see people play this game all over the place   many people have be talk highly about this game and the other baldur gate games   I have be play this game for a couple of month and I can agree that this game be entertaining and there be so many option and path for any player to go through   but after a while the game dose repeat itself its a game that have a set story and you the player just have to make the choice within the story
when I first start play   it consume my entire day   I hadn t play a game like that since I have summer break   that s how it feel   it give I that nostalgic feeling of play the one game you love so much   it be a significant part of your childhood   when I finish the game for the first time   I be actually dread it   cause I know the feeling would be over   then   I find out the replayability of this game be insane   my next character still give I a bit of that initial feeling   because my choice be so different that it have change the game into almost a new one    if you re in it for the story and choose your own dialogue   but be unsure about turn base combat as I be   then you may be pleasantly surprise   just like d d of course   there be so many different way you can play that it ll appeal to you somehow   not just thing like your class   but how you approach your fight   how you use item   use the environment   or you can avoid a lot of it by talk it out instead   sometimes   I forget how much creative freedom I have in this game    I love choose your own adventure game and this be one have be the most in depth to I so far   your action and dialogue choice aren t just there to get a couple different line out of an npc   but to actually influence a lot of the world in way you may not even notice unless you replay several time   I m the type that have to look at and loot everything   yet I ve replay the game so many time and I m still find new item   area   scene or dialogue I never see before
 
good game ever make
very fun   love that be kinda like d d
shadowheart
great game   avoid the zesty scene tho   
this game truly be art
stunning   brilliant   balder   gate
one of the good game
the close thing I ve find to play d d solo
love this   I really didn t expect to enjoy it as much as I do   graphic be excellent   customization of character be great and overall story be just so expansive   I can not stop restart because I want to explore so much or do something different every time   its no wonder this win so many award
if you like make a character   play the first act of the game   and then be overwhelm by quest and restart just to make another character   absolutely the game for you   d
free I from wow   thumbsup
a          masterpiece
amazing game only ick be that act    you need a really good pc when you get to act     there s so much stuff there that the frame drop dramatically   however   the game be so good I d play it even if all it have be act     make build be really fun and when you finally learn how to make good one the game get so satisfying   I love shoot    arrow a round that each do     damage on average   the story be insanely well write and you can really just do anything and you can destroy the game as much as you like it s crazy to I that the devs put thousand of hour into write a character   that you can simply get rid of if you don t like   for example   in my first playthrough I never find lae zel and the second playthrough I do I find she and my entire game change   the ending change   mind blow   usually game force you to collaborate with the npc and tolerate those you don t like    all the character be good though     except wulbren bongle
this game be really good the big problem be that whenever you start play you will never finish this game like ever because when you gather friend to play you those same friend will become cursed and be unable to play the game because of they be   busy   this   busy   curse be unable to be break even with   great restoration   if anyone find out how to break that curse let I know I have try everything I even kill they and revivify they to remove it but it didn t work hopefully you never encounter this curse it could be bug too but yeah enjoy play this masterpiece while you can
   I be thoroughly impressed with my experience so far
silly wizard man I love you
gud
I love it
easily one of the good game I ve ever play   there really be no reason not to try it out   if the sole reason you play game be for competition or action and have no interest in story I can see an argument as to why this isn t for you but otherwise a must play
yuesd
nice
good
honestly   just worth the full price      probably first aaa since starcraft ii or civ    that I feel it deserve the full price I pay for it   the game have about      hour content for first playthrough but the way its construct suit it well to replay it a few time due to many end possibility you can get depend on how you progress your story character and possibility of play as one of the    origin character which themselves have few ending each per oc   along with that the story itself be very well write with great character and many plot twist even in the moment when you think you already know the whole plot somewhat   the game can still surprise you with a new revelation you haven t think about    the quality level of this gem of a game in my opinion make it good to play even if you be not that much into turn base rpg game
one of the good game that I have ever play     game be actually fully complete and have almost no in app purchase   or you know   the pay to win stuff that s in a lot of game   I like that you can play the game without internet and have different save slot   and love that you can customize your character apperence or go with a main story line character   game graphic and cut scene be absolutely phenomenal and over all the game be absolutely worth its price   I be expect the game to be underwhelme because of the size against the price   but after play it for the first time   the game be worth so much more than       highly recommend it if you like game similar to diablo iv or that catagory
this game remind I of d d for some reason
great
this game be amazing   one of the good I have ever play   every single character be a treat to engage with   I m definitely go to be come back to this one
good
goat game

big boss   die twice because I didn t strategize   shove he into hole   gg ez
it s alright   the game be pretty   the character be well write and the amount of way you can play out the story be insane   character customization option be also fun to play around with   I be   however   just not quite feel it with the turn base combat   that one isn t for I personally   if you don t mind that   fantastic game
great game   integrate mod platform be amazing
far and away my favorite game of all time   I buy new game play they for like an hour then come back to this game     complete playthrus to many to count of mayhem partial
good game ever since skyrim
a modern game that somehow go above and beyond the value of its price tag
       hrs    still have not finish    do not want the story to end
if you like rpgs base around dungeon and dragon gameplay you ll love this game
not a turn base combat fan but this game be amazing   one of the very few game I didn t mind pay full price for
good game ever   want to play more game like this
this game be pretty good
this will probably go down as one of the good game of all time   I be hesitant myself to try a turn base game   but this game do it so well   if you enjoy dnd   this be a must play   the story be just so good and the character have such amazing dialogue
fun with friend
fun
be goo
well
somehow even well than divinity  
leave this just to add yet another positive review it s worth all the praise it get
just a great game
restart    time to change my class and ultimately make a new character with the original class anyway   also sex   game of the year
one of my favorite game that I ve ever play   I ve never play a game like this before so it be a little intimidating at first   but the tutorial be extremely helpful and actually useful   and the game be definitely worth it for the price   just one play through be     hour
hand down   the good game in year        hour play and I m still uncover new thing   the writing   voice act   character customization   class multi class   combat   and mod make this game very re playable    my only wish be that   act    spoiler   
obligatory      post     good game be good    
haven t play in probably a year but still appreciate how amazing this game really be be     especially when compare to some of the hot garbage aaa game studio have be put out the last few year
ball ball ball ball ball
minthara my beloved
game be good   intro and first part of act    be a bit meh but it just keep get well and well the long you go
       great game and even well with friend
at first I couldn t get into the combat   because I be just terrible   but I watch a few tutorial on yt and keep go and I very quickly became enthral by the complexity and in depth system in this game   listen to the hype   this game be insane when it come to the rpg element   I will say though I think the way the camera work while explore can be frustrating at time as well as the way you loot or interact with the environment   other than that this game be a solid        
it be game of the year for a reason    the strong part of this game be the roleplay element   and despite have a more linear story it still provide a lot replayability boost even more by great mod support   I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn t mind the tactical   turn base combat style
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     larian                                                                                             
didn t get on with it at first   but once I start to understand the mechanic it all start to fall into place   also think combat be really slow to begin with but as I gain level my guy become powerhouse in their area   make combat a lot more fun    as someone that didn t initially enjoy it   all I can advise be stick with it
great storyline and keep you engage although walking be long and sometimes you can get lose on side mission but that s a plus for I not sure how other would take it though
buy for astarion late last year on ps    buy again on pc because I miss my beloved
it s a great game   I ve never like turn base strategy or even try a crpg before this but I find the story pretty compelling and once I learn how to go about combat to a decent degree it all kind of clicked and I start enjoy it   I m apprehensive to say it be only a year since release but I d argue it s the most I ve enjoy a game ever   maybe I ll lose the rose tint glass at some point but     month in and I keep come back for more playthrough   build   multiplayer and mod   it also get I to give other turn base game a try and before I don t think I would ve   the only negative be that I can t play other crpg s of the the same ilk like   pathfinder wotr   because the mechanic and story be just not on the same level as bg    I m not hate on pathfinder to be clear   ton of people love it and I m sure for good reason but baldur gate definitely spoil I on the crpg experience   if I have to do it over a again I d play divinity os    pillar of eternity series and pathfinder before even touch bg     tldr     worth the money    wish I try other crpg s first    karlach good companion
awesome plot and game design   live another live in game
it good
over      h   what more be there to say
the introduction to dnd I didn t know I need
such a wonderful game and story   solid d d mechanic   excellent graphic   and the writing voice acting add serious serious depth

never play dnd before   new to the dice mechanic        suck   unless you put buff on the roll   but when you get a nat     ohh baby ohh baby   talk my way out of pretty much any situation outside off boss fight   will do another run with friend
while I m not go to pretend that d d   e offer the most astounding gaming experience    especially at the table    it do keep thing easy to pickup in a video game environment   especially when compare to other crpgs of the past    the true magic of this game be the staggering amount of way you can approach it   roleplay   dialogue   and creative thinking be all reward in this game    npc seem to be a hit or miss for I   some be extreme standout while other be about as exciting as a loaf of bread   just my two cent    also   as a huge fan of the og baldur s gate game   I wish this be its own thing as it can conflict with the countless way those game   decision could be play out by make certain one canonical    either way   this be a stellar game that have propel game forward   maybe not as much as what some people want to claim   and bring the crpg genre into a lot of people s radar
very adventurous absolutely love the game so much to interact with and never ever bore especially with the vampire
bhaal fav   babygirl
incredibly excellent game          make dozen of character   halfway through my   nd full playthrough
take I    different playthrough to get to the end of the game and then the cosmetic mod that I have enable disabled acheivement        would play again
big red muscle mommy for life    pluse there be other interesting people and spell and stuff I guess
this game be fun   especially when you have friend who play with you consistently   even if just have two friend to play the game

great role playing game I have ever play    literally the only negative be some of the fight take I and my mate so long to think about and commit to attack etc that we literally nearly lose our job through tiredness         would go to war to protect these developer
deep character creation   choice that matter   tactical engaging combat   strong replayability potential   rewarding exploration   innumerous way to approach both combat and world interaction with true repurcussion   reward   and consequence base on player choice   plethora of unique item   top tier build diversity and complexity   a strong quality list of quality voice unique companion with their own world view   moral   and personality

I ve empty my ball to this game a million time and I ve now ascend to another dimension outside of the human brain peak comprehension         would recommend
worth every cent

banger   cure my depression   I would die and kill for gale   I actually probably have
astarion be the love of my life   I will not elaborate furthur
this be the only game that have put I in the spot of what be good and what be great   the game be really simply put as      great   or oustande even   I don t think any of we have ever play a game where so many option be available   I remember buy baldur s gate    for pc when I be        year of age   I couldn t run it smoothly and I just only discover rpg s   I have an atari   nintendo   and a sega grow up   I be always a history and deep fantasy nerd   my local blockbuster and mom pop video store never have anything to offer for the sega gensis   so I didn t discover rpg s till the time I convince my mom to by I a ps   and I also begin to emulate sne games on my dad computer   this game be amazing and although I ve never beat it   I do recommend you take your chance in becoming engage in the world that be offer with bg    there be not another single game I would recommend outside of this one   please   engage   explore and have fun   you win t regret it    
lgbtq   friendly w o force you to be lgbtq   friendly   bioware take note
I honestly be not sure how I be go to feel about this game   start out do not like the movement mechanic   do not like the no chat box feature   but the graphic be amazing so end up find some addon that allow you to move with the arrow key and chat box feature it really transform my game play experience   def recommend with addon
good game ever
probably one of the good game I ve ever play   if you be ever interested in dnd or be a seasoned dnd player   this be the game for you
its pretty good
great game once you get into it
can t get anywhere because I can t read a map to save my life   but I ve never have such a good time get hopelessly lose
it be a very fun game         experience   there be so much to do   and so much you can mod
I can cast eldritch blast and halsin be pretty   good game
idk what      of the item and spell do but I be still have fun      
perfection
nothing to be say about this game that hasn t be espouse already   an absolute must play in every sense   a once in a generation game that will never ever be fully match and will continue to stand on its own merit     year from now   if you be on the fence I adore you because it take some biblical level of dissonance to have decide not to play it at this point   you be in for a once in a lifetime treat
this game be by far the most compelling and beautiful game I ve ever play   you can play this game     time and still discover new thing and new dialogue   brilliant
literally the game ever   there be no more game than this   highly recommend         video game
good
its awesome
amazing
where do my      hour go   
have no friend to start a dnd campaign   have no fear   baldur s gate    be here   seriously   the perfect dnd game to play when you get no friend to play with   also   white haired   sassy vampire man   yes   please

""
good
noice
great game   lot of fun    super awesome companion
great game it be a great game with consequence   your choice matter to what happen in the game
ball
everyone should play
great game   if you loot everything   try to do every optional quest   and take your time read everything in game   you might take over      hour to finish the game like I do   I play it entirely on the steam deck lcd with a    fps cap turn on   the turn base combat make it very steam deck friendly since put the deck to sleep doesn t feel like you re interrupt the flow of the game   that let I play the game in chunk of     minute or    hour at a time
in my opinion   this be as close to a masterpiece as any game can get   and there be many highlight that have make it so for I     the character be flesh out   their development be dynamic and fun to experience   the dialogue be incredible   and even the little micro conversation character have with each other out in the world deepen their lore in interesting way    the map be large   but far from empty feeling   there be always something to see   find   loot   fight   check out   interact with   whatever   constantly   all the time   when travel between location   the environment be well render and consistently change   that be   every area feel unique   and each have its own personality and opportunity to advance the story   your character   and the game experience    the combat   if you like turn base   be excellent   the movement be well plot   though fight in multi level area can lead to some frustration when you accidentally hover over the wrong floor and whatnot    the interaction between character and enemy feel fair   and tactical thinking be well reward    you can do essentially whatever you want to solve problem   each puzzle   issue   interaction you run into have multiple way to solve it   each way carry its own challenge and benefit   and often its own reward   additionally   how you choose to proceed often matter just as much as your choice to undertake a challenge at all which   again   be simply an option you may ignore oftentime    choice matter   this game breathe around you   and how you interact with it define how it take form    massive replay value   whether try a legacy character and experience each of your party s original story   or rock the dark urge   or do your fifth unique custom character   which   to be fair   I ve start so many character just base on how the first few hour be completely different depend on what race class combo you choose   and the rest of the game seem to follow suit    you can just keep try new thing   and enjoy new outcome    co op be dynamic and fun   the way you can interact with your friend on the road   or during dialogue moment   like kill someone while they be threaten your friend   end dialogue mid sentence and leave say friend confuse   apropo of nothing   obviously    be a constant source of laugh or   at the very least   great time share    one thing that will absolutely be a massive turnoff for some new player    there be quest that can be fail simply because you take too long   there be interaction that will be completely different depend on how long it take for you to find they   these will alter your experience   though not for the bad   simply for the different    and some may find this frustrating   however   there be comprehensive list online that people have make to prevent this from affect those who absolutely don t want to experience it   so problem solve    I m go to be play this game for year   easily   alone   with friend   whatever   I love this game    if you re into rpgs   turn base combat   vast dialogue option   and large   fairly open world map   this one be for you
astarion   need I say more
perfect literally no note
absolutely addict to play   time absolutely fly
I would pay a lot to experience it again for the first time
I don t even like tactical rpgs or d d and yet I still put      hour into bg      that speak volume about how good this game be
magical
you can do whatever you want in the game   be it yell at child   punching jerk in the face   throwing say jerk and kid from cliff   laugh maniacally while do say thing and also hang out with your friend while do those thing
good story   good character   un modde ui suck   caite improvement make it really good    gameplay be good if you like somewhat active turn base   loot system be kinda meh   too much stuff that be not much good once you can get to it   optimize build and change when go to the next act
still a great game    you can befriend   date   or kill any or all of your teammate   it s the ultimate choice base strategy game   you can toss anyone or anything off a cliff   lot of explosive          it s a long game   which I like   but if you don t have much free time   you might have a hard time finish it
a game like bg   come around once every     year or so   I didn t say that   my cousin do during our last session     brother     cousin   all reunite to run campaign     from around the country after not even talk much over year   this game be magical   and I don t even intent the pun there
every run through be the same story arc but different character s and choice bring different outcome   keep it fresh and fun
playing game with the experience on watch a   d movie   the graphic and story be superb
start the game for        because it be in the homie s library but then I end up log like     hour within the month I download it   good game would recommend to other homie
as someone who generally hate third person rpgs like this   I absolutely love this game   the story and writing be great and I feel like even though I ve never play any of the previous baldur gate game   this game do a great job inform you of lore and history within the universe   lot of replayability as there be many different way to go about how you do thing   and the mod only add to the replayability even more   graphic be beautiful and voice acting be great as well   overall they do a very good job at teach you and make you care about the world and character in a way I feel extremely few rpg game do
great game      hr on console
devs really need to polish this game   there s cobwebs everywhere
so good
the story be fun   the combat be unique   like I mix to real time strategy and some time thing you would typically think you could do you can
the dice god show no mercy
my playtime be wrong due to need to be offline for mod    finish a      hour play through today   easily one of the great game ever play   it have be a long time where I feel lost on what to do because I ve finish it   such a huge fantastic game with easy replay ability    I think this game will be hard to top    the bad thing about this game be we will never get any more content from larian in this world
great game   still find new and fun way to play even the vanilla version after       hour
amazing game that s influence the new       version of d d itself   highly recommend especially with larian s embrace of modding which make it similar to what skyrim do for bethesda
get bang by a demon        
    hour in   I ve meet all the character on the cover of the game s box art   I haven t scratch the surface    I ve   like scratch at the sticker seal the box   and the edge have raise   so I know if I scratch a few more time I may gain purchase to start peel the sticker off    I haven t be this engage or obsess by a game in a looong time   I m think about it when I m not play   it s truly   next gen   when compare to its close relative     witcher     divinity    and      and it have thus far surpass they all    and as an adaptation of d d   it s peak   I mean it sometimes lack the feel that I could do anything   but that s understandable      this isn t really a review   I m sure I ll have more to say   but my god I m love this   
get ask to play with some people   one dude have to update   spend    hour look at a dwarf ice spice before hop off without even start         experience would create character again
   
this be a great continuation to the original one    
I can see myself rplaye this for hoursss
what can I say that have not be say before   objectively speak   this might be the good game to exist to thhis day in it s genre
  
this game rock
meh
this game be a lot of fun I do not know I like dnd that much damn
great story line   character development   and combat   great to play solo or coop   highly recommend
I be skeptical at first   and then suddenly I ve finish the game and be on my second playthrough     
one of the few rpgs that take role play seriously
I love this game and I love astarion I love you larian
literally   the good game ever
great game      
its fun   the end
game make for all those lonely simp out there       
gale dekario
a once in a generation level of incredible game   if you have any interest in roleplay or tactical combat   this be an easy recommend   it s about as close as you can get to a perfect game   some optimization stuff aside   as possible   there be so so many different path through the game   different origin with their own unique story   different party composition   different build to play   no two playthrough be the same   I ve do at least    start to finish in both solo and co op campaign   and never once have it feel remotely the same   the main story be brilliantly write   the voice act be probably the good I ve ever see outside of ffxiv   there be so much optional content to do   secret to find   companion story to explore and relationship to develop    just buy it   seriously
excellent game for rpg enthusiast   brilliant for coop
one of the good game I have be ever play
just buy it already
maybe my favorite game ever and I m only like halfway through
eh   it s okay I guess
I m sure this will be a very good game   my immersion keep be break by the thought that my friend be likely jack off to the sex scene though
the game have that comfort rpg quality   where my first playthrough be like      hour   and now I m just perpetually start new character on the pc version   you twist your ankle or something and just hop on the bg   character creator for eight hour   dream about your life as a guardian of the downtrodden    also cloud of dagger be like if a lightsaber throw last ten          turn        be disgusting and I love it     good writer be pervert   also apply here   except this be a video game   so it s everyone from writer and visual artist to programmer and level designer
be good
almost like d d   awesome game
wasn t kaugha on the detroit piston back in      
I ve purchase this game on three platform now   pure perfection   
you can boink a bear
n o      toa que este jogo ganho o pr mio de melhor jogo do ano   simplesmente uma obra de arte   super recomendo       veze
the graphic and great   the story line be fantastic and I love how it be more like pen and paper d d than other game   the game be enjoyable play solo or with a group
sensational         crpg
very fun so far   but god forbid I do not roll nat    on the most important roll of my gameplay
I may only be a level    wizard   but I m a level     barrelmancer    a game where you get infect with the woke mind virus and put worm in your brain to grow your woke psionic power    its dungeon and dragon for people without friend   or if you do have friend but nobody want to dm   genuinely phenomenal    larian please I m beg you   make a vampire the masquerade game I would pay        just to play it for a few hour
great game with a lot of depth   so many side quest and a huge open world to explore
good vampire and bear date sim        
gud gam
not use to turn base combat   but it s be fun so far
its a little buggy on mac but its great
if you think you will not enjoy the gameplay   get this game because as a main fps gamer   this game be a solid rpg and the gameplay be ingenious
love this game     I be totally addicted
larian above all
love this game   possibly my favorite of all time   I love that it s basically dungeon and dragon the video game   I love choose prompt that roll the dice and create character with high bonus in certain ability   such as persuasion    it also double as a tutorial to basic d d   so I d recommend it even if you have no d d experience
baldur s gate    be what I imagine a love letter to fan of the original and d d be   the absence of micro transaction allow the player to fully immerse themselves into a fantasy world   intrigue   mystery   light amount of horror   dark urge    romance and compelling writing all add to the immersion   as do create a fully customizable character   larian s incredible team have outdo themselves with this game   I highly recommend give this game a shot
due to how amazing this be I can not enjoy other game anymore  
very good   very nice
very good   I love the autistic wizard
rpg greatness   honestly one of if not my favorite game of all time
great implentation of d d   lot of strategic mechanic to play with
good game
epic
this type of game have never be my cup of tea but baldur s gate iii absolutely rock   I genuinely do not know how this game exist   there be just so much in every single corner and so many different dialouge option   I can t wait to beat my first run and see how my second run play out
my first dnd experience    would play again        insane masterpiece    live   all mortal life expire soul go to their doom in flame forevermore hell   hell   hell have it s law hell   hell   effect and the cause curtain fall   but hold your applause squirm   squirm   for now down here come the claws live   all mortal life expire soul go to their doom in flame forevermore fool   fool   how hard you have fight brave   brave   but it s all be for naught true soul   that couldn t be buy doom   detect   and catch no more deal   it s over the final act   your doom no more grace   it s over this house of hope consume
I do not write alot of review   and lot have be say about baldur s gate     I find the camera movement a bit odd   but everything work fine   dialog and charakter development be awesome   the level cap at     be a little sad   since I could probably have reach level     or      anyhow    my recommendation for every player of the original bg series or people with tactical experience be   do not play on easy or   normal   difficulty   go to the tactician mode   otherwise you can just camp when you feel like it and end up be always well prepared
take I almost a year to actually complete the last fight cuz I m lazy but the overall experience be great   I give it     duck     
good rpg ever
great game for hour of fun and adventure
game of the year
owlbear
   make sweet lesbian love with karlach   win the game basically
larian   make gortash romancable for dark urge   and my life be yours

   a story that will always remain in my heart baldur s gate    be more than a game   it s a journey that become a part of you   touch your heart and soul   I ve complete this adventure four time now   and each time I ve discover new facet    as if it be my first time enter a world where every step be intertwine with thought and feeling   admire the depth of every choice and the complexity of every fate   who would have think that the character I meet along the way would become so close to I   this journey make I think about the essence of loyalty   the risk of trust   the importance of sacrifice   and the true price of my own justice    for I   this game be perfect   there be not a single element that feel unfinished   an endless world where everything seem to be possible   each character breathe and live next to you   each have their own character   their own fear and their own secret   storyline   battle mechanic   and music create a magical atmosphere that be completely immersive   the feeling that you can change your fate and the fate of those around you add weight to every action and every dialog    if you re ready to open your heart   take all the risk   and plunge into a world where your choice have real meaning   this adventure be for you   baldur s gate    be a game for those who want not just to win   but to find a piece of themselves in it   so that maybe they can leave this world a little different
great gameplay   storyline   voice act   replayability   worth the hype

murderhobo
goat
good game
brilliant game   I play this at launch on ps   and a year later I finally buy a pc so I could literally play this game with mod   I have never double dip on a game in my life until now         in my top three game ever
mahkloompah       immersive   fun     game of a lifetime     good rpg ever   highly recommend
a truly once in a decade experience   my very minor gripe with the game be drown out by the sheer creativity and passion that be clearly put into it   my wish be that other studio take note and inspiration from it
one of the most interesting story line I have see in a game for a long time   I need a good single player game that be complete   now I be go to play it again and hope I don t make myself sad with the choice I make   d
the bee knee
a great and mind blow game   an absolute must play that offer rich variety of game play    it take I    h to make it to baldur s gate   and I have ton more to play   high replay ability   I m think of start another playthrough soon     mechanic and gameplay be great and engage   the story telling be superb and rich   the character be likable   well write and reason    the setting and the environment be amazing too   the game perform well on all type of hardware and be very well optimize   the experience be well polished    as mention already   a must play
     
play this on ps   and on pc         well date sim on the market and the story be fantastic   larian be truly the mvp
I m only thirteen hour in   but baldur s gate    have already become one of my all time favorite game   the character and story be well write   with verisimilitude and player engagement in mind   the gameplay be both balanced and customizable   and the voice act be some of the good in recent year   even though it be a completely different franchise   I can not help but be remind of all the strength of dragon age origin   which have long be the gold standard for this type of game   it s a little early to tell for sure yet   but so far it look like bg   may be come for dao s crown   or at the very least a strong second    that it be base on d d show   it take I back to the thrill of adventure I feel when I first discover tabletop rpgs in the early    s    be it perfect   oh   I can find flaw   but they be few   minor   and far between   for example   at first I be disappoint that I couldn t customize my character s face beyond    pick one of the handful of pregen we ve provide    but within an hour of actual gameplay   that minor gripe be overshadow by the excellence of every other part of the game    I also recognize that the lack of face customization be also probably much of why the facial animation be so good   mean that the lack of sculpting I take as a flaw likely contribute to the game strength     overall   baldur s gate    belong in the library of everyone who enjoy story   and character drive fantasy game
moans softly   it s just too good
game developer should look at this game as an example of how to make good rpgs
well rpg I ve play
great
baldur s gate baby here
simply the good package you can get if you want a crpg   aaa production value   insane level of player agency and overall a polished experience
my partner and I have be play this game on the same account   thus the rack up hour    he s be a lifelong d d player dm   and I be a complete noob   we both love this game   even after you finish the main story   there s many more way you can experience the game   it s like play a new game over    over again   the graphic be beautiful   the voice cast be stellar   the game play itself be daunt at first    I get the hang of it after a few hour   you can tell that a lot of love go into this game
there be tit an       but you don need to play wit they so that coolk that you can if you want but really why would u jus go watch porn lil bro amen bless up grat game tho

amazing game that deserve all the praise it receive in the past   I m over     h in and still on my first playthrough   that say   I be already look forward to start a new character to have they tell a new story   fantastic game     it could very well be one of the all time great that people will refer to when look at game history in the future
own this for both steam pc and ps    pc have more mod choice   the game be awesome and I totally recommend it for everyone   it have allow I to play many of the class I don t normally play and learn more about d d as a whole
I didn t know what to expect from class and combat system in this game   so I choose a paladin to do a quick play through   the   quick play through   turn out to be an awesome      hour adventure      tadpole out of

an absolute masterpiece in gameplay and dynamic storytelling   the combat be fantastic even for someone like I who have minimal knowledge of dnd   and the character be very vivid and fun to interact
