red dead redemption    be an absolute masterpiece from the story line to the visual   arthur morgan be one of the most beautifully write character of all time
this be the ultimate barbie race and ride experience   everything from the horse ride to the saddle customisation good horsey game I have ever play   only minus be that you can t soap up the horse with a rag and wash it
the good advice I can give you to achieve the good experience be to avoid rush through it   at least for the first time    explore the world of red dead redemption    as much as you can and interact with the life happen around you    give it time and let the game introduce itself to you   every detail will go to worth it and in three word   enjoy the adventure
red dead redemption    be one of those game that stay with you long after you ve finish play   it be   quite literally   unforgettable   the world feel alive   with gorgeous landscape that make you want to explore every corner   none of which disappoint   every character feel real   and every moment   big or small   leave a last impact   it s a game that pull you in with its beauty   but keep you with its deep   emotional storytelling   arthur morgan s journey be beautifully write   and to I   nothing can compare    it s       worth the price   and on sale it s a steal   get it if you can   you will not be disappoint  
this game be so good that it have officially ruin my gaming experience with any other game   it really be that good   I m now spoil   it s kind of like once you fly first class    fly economy be the bad experience   if you ve never play this game then be prepare for an emotional roller coaster that will have you laugh so hard one minute then cry your eye out the next    my only fear be that at the way video game be now a day that read dead    be go to be absolute garbage unless they stick to the same formula they do with this    side note   online will disappoint you   just don t   if I could go back in time and only have play the story while never ever even look at the online part I would   it s like go to a restaurant and they serve you the good meal you ever have    story mode   then they tell you they have a special dessert for you   online   and you get so excited because your expectation be now a dish worthy of god himself and they bring you a stale cracker with some whip cream on it   then a dog come by and lick off the whip cream
the game of game you have not play a more polished game in your life and probably win t for a while until rockstar come out with another game   this game be at this point already    year old and remain an unreached milestone in immersion   open world density   depth of interaction and and and   the amount of option   choice   character   randomly occur event and never end amount of exploraton you have in this one game be quite astonishing   play this you will continually ask yourself how in the world they manage to put this together to make it a real game   and again   this be    year ago already   I guess a lot of devs have to suffer some intense crunch for year to make this brilliant game a reality   it really show   they take an insane amount of precaution for immersion on all front and to never let it break   the historically accurate depiction of the wild west be another thing we ve most definitely never see before in a video game   this basically be a hollywood western movie implant into a game   that even in the most minor way you can imagine will be remember by npc in the game   you steal something in a bar   even after month of ingame time they will remember you there as a thief and also what specifically you steal   npc you kill in the wild will remain lay there   unfound   rot   vulture gather   you can observe the decomposure day by day   you can also tie people up and feed they to the aligator      and I mean     if that s not a        game   then I don t know what be   lmao   prove that they be the good in the industry by a long shot   consider they have be come out with groundbreaking game consistently since gta     and this game in particular still stand tall as one of the great achievement in gaming development as a whole to this day   every once in a while we all have these outlandish thought that   you know I wish I could do this or that in a game   and then you realize that s maybe too far out there for a game to be advanced enough to meet that expectation   this be the game where you can actually do some of those thing    it s actually quite worrying if anyone be go to reach that level again anytime soon   if at all   the game have be in development for like    year   so for anyone to spend that time   have the talent   vision and direction to even make it this great and also take the giant risk to commit to it for so many year   have not be do by many   especially big studio and will probably become more rare in the future   just like with modern cinema   sh t out something average with high production for guarantee sale and that s about it   low risk   high reward   so imo it remain doubtful how many deeply original game aaa like these we ll continue to have       and wow   I ve say   game   like     time in this review

a monumentally huge game with an unprecedented level of detail and the result atmosphere   which be difficult to find competition   fantastic audiovisual   a magnificent soundtrack   an interesting narrative and   un likable character whose fate be etch in the memory    the starting line be extremely simple   dutch s gang be on the run after a botched heist   he need to find enough resource not only for survival   but above all for a definitive escape somewhere far away and even far   where everyone will start a new life   but it s not that simple and the gang doesn t stick together the way dutch would like   external pressure be gradually add to internal one   one story event follow another   and conflict of all kind begin to increase in intensity   with your permission   I win t tell you anything about the story itself and even more about its outcome   luckily   rockstar also hold their tongue   and if you don t let the game get spoil somewhere else   you ll be in for quite a few big surprise    thank to the large length of the game   the character have enough room for development   and that there be room to develop   the creator really didn t rush anything   they let the internal and external conflict mature properly   and when it bubble to the surface and it come to break bread   some scene can make you emotional   more than once   my eye widen in surprise   I have goosebump   or I feel outright disgust at the action of certain character   and I laugh out loud several time    rockstar have also not be afraid of controversial topic for a long time   and the story of red dead redemption be no exception   dutch s gang play the absolute primordial role   but now and then the story can easily touch on such topic as slavery   colonialism   treaty with indians   torture   racism   woman s right   etc   but it be never a significant part of the game   just as from i don t feel that the creator be try to push any agenda of their own    you can enjoy john marston here as one of the gang member   but arthur morgan be the main driver of the game   an outlaw   gangster and one of the most loyal and senior member of dutch s gang   arthur be tough   uncompromising and not afraid to kill   but he have his own sense of honor and order   arthur be primarily yours   and that sense of honor and order may or may not suit your perception of such thing   with unobtrusive and obvious decision   you gradually shape this stubborn lump of model to your own image   both internally and externally    the gang be chase by one calamity after another   and the oppressive realization settle in the soul of its member that it probably win t get any well   you will know each of they by name   understand why they be with you   and love they   or to hate he   of course   but never because of some primal evil that the creator would throw at you like a piece of meat to bite into   and that be also the mark of a well write actor    I have already come up with the right word to describe this game   unprecedented
edit   hold up       like don t add any more like   a single review can not justify the glory of this game      I can say nothing that would add more to the unbelievable story telling and visual this game provide    hear people complain about the price increase in some region but it be alright    many mediocre game be sell at a very high price point that be completely nuts    meanwhile this be a gem of game   once in a lifetime experience as arthur morgan    it s slow   relaxing yet action pack and emotional    rating this game        be a disgrace because its over         if you want to experience peak of gaming and the enjoy the good of the good       well   you should play red dead redemption      once in a lifetime   if there be a way to experience this again for first time I would definitely try it    some screenshot               
one of the good story game I have ever play   good atmosphere in any game
amazing game I can never get enough of it   from vanilla to modded its all just so amazing this game be a definitly must
I will give my opinion after play it twice and I must say that it be excellent in every way gameplay   music   character   environment and     more than anything   the story of the game attract you   that be   the more you play the game   the more you get involve with it   and I m sure you will cry by the end of the story   not because of the story   because of everything         red dead    be the good thing I have ever experience and I definitely recommend you to try it once       
arthur morgan be one of the most compelling character in gaming   embody the complexity of loyalty   morality   and redemption   as a loyal member of the van der linde gang   he grapple with his past action and the shift dynamic of his world   his journey be mark by profound introspection and growth   reveal a deeply human side beneath the rugged exterior   arthur s relationship with other character   especially his mentor dutch and fellow gang member   add layer to his story   make his eventual quest for redemption all the more impactful   overall   arthur morgan be a beautifully write character whose struggle resonate long after the game end
separate launcher need to stop    look I m a bit hypocritical when it come to buying game that require a   rd party launcher   but man do it suck and want to make I resort to pirate cause half of these game that have single player or be single player only require online to even just launch the launcher cause the developer be too lazy to implement a offline mode for their launcher and ultimately their game   I know that its a rare occasion when I would need to worry about offline but I m a pennys to dollar type of guy so when that unfortunate timing of internet crash or bad rockstar be down its just bloatware cause I can not launch it feel like I waste money on useless code and model   and man I love red dead use to play the hell out of it on console even rdr   back in the day so naturally I be excited when I hear rdr   be come this month but see that rockstar require online I wouldn t be surprised that rdr   require it too    so rockstar I beg of you if you want to stop piracy implement a offline mode for your freaking launcher and game you re practically beg for game to be pirate cause of greed and laziness   I refuse to give you all positive praise cause I know one day it ll be go cause of this scummy strategy
what a game   what an outstanding story   this be one of those game where I wish I could forget it so that I could experience it for the first time again   the visual be phenomenal and the acting and mo cap be stellar   an issue I have personally be that some of the mission feel a bit draw out and long I e   unskippable ride to x   kill enemy   do   a fair amount of these mission be like that   however that be not nearly enough to dissuade I from recommend this game   the story be absolutely masterful   a story of action   love   loss and tragedy that I be sure an entire generation be go to remember for a very long time   sadly   rockstar game have basically abandon the online   which I think have an incredible amount of potential   it s worth a play if you want a hundred hour of fun or so   but the story mode be where it s at   and I would        recommend this game
this be a game stuff full of content with a high level of care take in almost every approach   it genuinely feel like what a proper   high budget    aaa   cinematic game should be    it contain one of the good living   breathing game world I ve encounter   and have such a high level of verisimilitude that I feel like it be set in the actual wild west   rather than be set in a dioramic toy town version that you can gallop across in     minute as it really be   the game have a genuine feeling of a real ecology   with everything down to the fly be present and it s hard to think of anything tangible that s miss   the rendering and streaming tech be magnificent and manage to create some of the most amazing vista that I ve see in a game   especially when combine with the discern eye of the designer who often manage to lead you in some fantastic spot in the mission or when camping   I can see why people spend thousand of hour in red dead online   just potter about in the world   though I ve yet to fire the onlone version up once    the main story mission be well do   entertaining   engaging and there s quite a lot of variety in the way they re   direct    mean it doesn t grow stale    I think one problem the game have be that it s swim in excellence   mean the player can easily drown   there s simply too much high quality content in there wait for the player to engage with it   the game would be perfect if it be just the main story line   but then all of the stranger mission   hunt   banditry   challenge   etc all add extra   stuff   to do that simply distract from that main storyline   as a player   it s very hard to avoid engage with that stuff   because it s so entertaining   so perhaps the designer should have have some restraint and hide most of it in the epilogue    the      hour here be do every mission possible   the majority of the challenge   and hunt most thing   I didn t bother with open world fishing   and didn t do anything after the credit roll   so the compendium sit at       I imagine that last      will take I another hundred hour   no thank        the game be at it s well when engage with the main story   and do a bit of hunt   there s a bit of dissonance in the fact that the story have you be an actual mean spirited outlaw at the start   despite your action in the open world be contrary to that   it also have a problem in that everything in mission seem to take place over the course of a short time period   a month    bu the open world happily let you spend    week hunt a single white bear   sometimes the story line devolve into   hold forward to keep play the movie game    which be something I usually despise   but it s such a good movie that I forgive it for be a terrible game experience at those same moment in time    for such a high quality game where almost everything about the main character be performance capture there can still be the occasional conversation that take place in the alternate universe where the game be play out use the uncanny valley   wobbly head mannequin version of the character   it s slightly distressing to know that with even all of the time   effort   and money spend on this game that it can still happen   but at the same time they ve go to great effort to record every conversation in a variety of way   so pelt it on horse back when far from your partner have the character converse at full shout   but if you re walk slowly they ll just be chat normally   it blend so seemlessly that it s hard to notice the attention to detail in even that aspect    then there s the camp conversation that add a huge amount of colour to the character   but it s weirdly implement so some majorly interesting and emotional stuff be spiel out by a companion only for arthur to go   ok   I ll leave you to it   and walk off   no   I want to hear more   or tell they I m sorry their   everyone   die    don t just walk off    the combat be pretty bland   and chore like at time   as implausibly large wave after wave of mook descend on your    especially on a controller   the saving system be atrocious   as be the want system   the control be completely overload on a standard controller to the point of it be a meme that you regularly accidentally curb stomp the person you re try to untie   or whatever   the lockon system be daft and never lock onto what you want   and despite there be a button for pull out your gun you ll often find yourself do it when you simply want to lock on someone to talk to they or pet your horse or whatever   it s quite madden at time   you get use to it   but it s such a pain at the start and mean you have to reload use the horrific save system because you just shoot some gun in the face when all you want to do be swap your gun about    the craft system be dreadful and should simply be excise from the game   it add nothing    I think the introduction   include the tutorial aspect of the game   be pretty terrible    but despite all of this I still think this be an amazing game that might even get a     if I be write for a magazine    ok I guess I ll see you later then
this game have insanely detail and immersive open world design   the landscape be breathtake   the world feel alive   and everything you do feel impactful   the story be deep and emotional   but the pacing can feel slow sometimes   especially with all the traveling   that say   the experience be totally worth it   especially if you enjoy open world game or western   you can really get lose in it for hour   explore and getting catch up in random event   red dead redemption    do a great job of make everything feel like it have mean   even the small task   it s a game where you can easily spend hour just wander and take in the atmosphere   I will gladly recommend buy it   just be ready to sink a lot of hour into it
  rd party drm that hardcode a link between your steam account and you can t switch account   which mean if you forget your rockstar account you can t play the game at all because it require always online    this need to go away
hosea   have a book john   have a family arthur   have a hat dutch   have a plan   
I don t need to convince you why this game be almost everyone s one of their good single player video game experience         
silently hike price   scummy publisher behavior rockstar join activision in silently hike price for game long after they have release   despite no change in usd price tier of          steamdb price chart   steamdb info   currency original price price after hike philippine peso                    indian rupee                ukrainian hryvnia             indonesian rupiah rp         rp         vietnamese dong                     scummy behavior from rockstar

this game have my respect   trust I   but f take    interactive   the game use to cost        in india which be expensive but still considerable at a decent discount and this game fully redeem the price tag    but yesterday   they quietly increase the price from        to        which be a freaking      hike in price   what be they even think   that s like more than a week s worth salary of an average indian    do they not care about we people in develop nation   there be a lot of we who buy game but by do this   t I rockstar game   you be just actively discourage the few of we who buy the game legally    honestly   f you t I   shame on you guy
the rockstar game launcher fail to initialize   reinstall and delete all its file do not fix the problem   those stupid launcher be like a p   I wish steam would not allow custom launcher
I love my horsey and my horsey love I
I love my horsey and my horsey love I
hell yeah br ther   good game   still a next gen game even in        no game like this
I want a femboy girl friend
it be very realistic with many detail and thing to do and the mission be unreal   so far play for      hour lol
masterpiece   still one of the good game ever make   on term of immersion   game play   and story    can be a bit buggy for this port   however   but still a         tag it and bag it
I m put together a team   of highly train personel     we will make the mojave desert great again   do you hear I    texas usa   twenty seven everyday   I m wake up in we aay but first   I get to agree to all the rockstar social club red dead redemption    rule    policy    okay guy     guy    get an anxiety attack     guy please   this would have never happen if you do not progress the main campaign  
this be not just a game    this be a experience    this be pure art   I m not      percent satisfied with rockstar because they keep on milk gta online instead of make more game    but when they realease a game    it s pure quality and nobody come close to their level of detail and gameplay    let s hope for a red dead redemption    release on steam    especially after so many rumour be see on the internet lately
the actual game           good game I ve ever play the issue    good luck try to launch this game   with the rockstar app not work   and soft lock I out of it   and the game just be stick on a forever loading screen   you will never actually get the chance to play this game   only way I can play be if I uninstall   reinstall and play it there and then   once I close it   I have to do it all over again   seriously   you would think a big cooperation like rockstar would be able to fix simple   simple thing like this   but rockstar have to be one of the bad game company I ve ever see   I would rather play all of ea s game then another rockstar one   horrible company and launcher   and if its not gtav   they be not fix any issue for it
rockstar have artificially increase the price after    year by only put the ultimate edition on sale which only offer additional content for the mulitplayer   on top of that   the multiplayer be abandon at this point and people who only want to play the singleplayer to begin with get screw over    rockstar s greed have reach a new level of patheticness   stop give money to company like rockstar
this game be amazing in many way   the realism   graphic   and story make you feel like you be in a       western world   though it lack in some way    some spoiler for the start of the game    the game be mainly base around graphic and story and both be amazing so let s start with the graphic   the graphic be beautiful to where it make you feel like you re in the game and it definitely show that detail and texture be the main focus of the game    the story be your average       type story   it s focused on a gang that have a lead on a ferry job in a town name blackwater carry          but the robbery fail and it turn into a violent and unwinnable gunfight between the gang and the pinkerton   far through the gang some member start change and it show some pretty good character change some change bad for the gang   I d say it s a pretty good story though sometimes it can be dumb    the gameplay be really fun when you first start it but at time it can feel stale at time which make I just not want to feel like play it    the traversal around the map can be very long   example there s a mission in chapter    that be all the way across the map and you have to ride for a pretty long while just to have a     or     minute mission   the mission also have the ride problem   but the dialogue keep it together and keep I you play    I give the game        it s not the great game ever but it also be really story and graphic base which I don t think be a problem but they could have make the gunplay a little funner and traversal around the map a little fast
decide to play this game after a long time   rockstar game launcher be ask for a verification code   sure no problem       except they re not send the code to I   confirm the e mail   try log in to their website   same thing   check inbox and spam   nada   verification code require   seem it s a common enough issue for people to post about it   l   can t play my purchase because their launcher be trash   
I hate rockstar launcher

its just beautiful
great game   but due to account issue I m lock out of play it   rockstar support be complete trash
   I heart man like arthur morgan
just one more big score   then we will farm mango in tahiti

the great title in entire gaming industry in term of vast open world graphic which be unmatched with many great title of nowadays    I m play it in       and I can t believe this be a       game         must play
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
I almost didn t play this game because of the need for the   third party rock star game launcher   and it be     gb to install   I m glad I get past this   I love rdr   on the       and rdr   have be awesome to play   one thing to note for those run a nvidia gpu   turn the taa sharpen   temporal anti aliasing   off   as it conflict with nvidia s dlss technology   once I d do this I have no issue with frame rate or crash   overall   red dead redemption    be the wild west at its good     
cowboy
a game its currenly riunine bug do not let I play the game I pruchase   nice cockstar nice
I will let the hour of playtime speak for the game
good game ever   my heart always lie with arthur   hat off to arthur morgan
time a changin   they don t want gamer like we no more
the soundtrack   the story   the graphic   the detail   character and their development   dialogue   mission   physics   control and simply just every single thing in the game be just amazing   make I laugh   make I cry   make I angry   make I sad and simply leave I agaped and amazed
an amazing game   simple as    probably the most detailed and immersive world I ve ever have the pleasure of experience   with a fantastic set of character you ll grow to love and hate   the beginning be a bit slow but it be very much worth all the setup    I can only hope the next game can live up to such high expectation leave by this one
long opinion piece   no spoiler ahead    howdy stranger   if you be one of the few people who hasn t play this highly acclaim masterpiece yet   then take heed    rdr   be an exceptional cowboy simulator with an incredible attention to detail   a technical marvel    and a very lousy videogame    people sing its high praise and I m not try to be a sourpuss and suck the ever love joy out it   in the end I m just some rando with opinion   after experience the game for      hour I feel like share my thought so I can move on        the gameplay       rdr s great strength be lose yourself in its big pretty world    it offer vast wildlife with dozen of different animal you can hunt   skin or simply observe   while gallivant across the west you visit town   go to a barber   rob train or set up camp and snack down that fish you catch early   you can even pat dog and horse    it s a unique and highly immersive experience   then you play the story section and everything take a massive nosedive    they re bad   like   bad        story mission       with minor exception they all follow the same formula    after a brief cut scene you press and hold a for    minute   listen to a bunch of dialogue while ride a horse and if you re lucky you might actually get to shoot something    usually though you must closely follow one of the many linear script set piece   and don t you dare go off script   you will ruin r   vision and fail the mission    go back to get a different weapon from your horse   mission fail   walk around a hut to flank the enemy   mission fail   cut through bush to catch up to some guy you ve be chase   mission fail    even when do it the right way   the very moment you play at your own pace somebody will start shout at you     arthur   where be you   it s time for the next scene   arthuuuur     shut up   dutch   I m loot corpse over here    this be a far cry from the classic r   day when player be offer actual freedom   I remember in vice city have to kill a guy at the golf course   the propose method be to walk in though the metal detector   lose your weapon and then chase he in a cart    but if you be creative enough you could jump over the metal detector by strategically park a car next to it   or steal a helicopter and bypass it all together    the old jank allow player to think outside the box   which make they really satisfy to play    rdr   be incredibly polished   but so on rail it actively punish you for explore its mechanic   r   stick their head so far up their pretentious stinkpillow   they forget to make mission actually fun to play    and in the word of the immortal reggie   if it ain t fun   why bother      if that lack of player freedom wasn t bad enough   the creativity on display be quite shocking indeed    there must have be a competition at r   about who can make the most vapid and pointless mission ever and they keep one up themselves    one have you steal an oil wagon that s just sit there with one measly guard who pose no threat   you hop in and ride away at an excruciating snail s pace   no backup   no chase   you press and hold a for    minute   that s it    heck   there s a mission that have you do actual chore    as in   shovel pig sht     the mission design be so impressively horrible we re reach desert bus level of awfulness and it make I wonder if the devs at r   ever play a game before        storytelling       rdr   be celebrate across the board and especially its story be regard by many to be among one of the good aaa gaming have to offer   but do that even mean anything nowadays    gamer be always quick to praise title that make they emotional and then downplay potential shortcoming   high accolade regard videogame story should always be take with a grain of salt     sorry   I m be snobbish   just remind you that elden ring be nominate for good narrative at the game award despite be compose entirely of vague lore snippet     the heart of the plot revolve around a want band of outlaws   be one big surrogate family   and its inevitable collapse   issue be   most member have little involvement in the actual story and be severely underwritten    rdr s narrative be so dense it become a problem   if you don t visit camp between mission or feel like join rob a random homestead you ll miss out on a lot of expositional dialog   this create an ever grow disconnect between story and player    sure   arthur care about these people    but I don t   I   d rather explore the wild and go hunt   maybe skin some rabbit for my collection    that beg the question   do we blame the player for not be thorough enough or the writer and their scattershot approach to storytelle    no idea   something to ponder   I suppose      he be not a particular interesting protagonist   sure   he s likeable   but that s about it    outside of his loyalty to his surrogate family he have no goal or ambition of his own and just do whatever dutch tell he to   doesn t even seem to have any hobby outside be the camp handyman    occasionally there be some potential shimmering through   but nothing come of they    when he scold john for abandon his wife and child I be hope it be because deep down arthur be envious and want he not to take they for grant    but that idea never materialize    there be also that mary character who tease a wilted romance   but that doesn t go anywhere    he do terrible thing out of blind loyalty   complain about it and when it look like he s finally come around his story end   the acting be phenomenal and the dialog be well write    but he s just   there    maybe that s on I   though   perhaps the writer expect I to read through the myriad of page in his journal to well understand his character in this exciting interactive videogame        story pace      hey   let s talk about the pacing   because that suck   too    tell a coherent story in an open world game with player loiter about for hour be never go to work smoothly   but rdr   drop the ball hard    play through the story be such a slog   it make you feel like a sloth high on opium   even the writer seem bored as they keep add more and more character that then fall by the wayside    this hodgepodge script juggle so many plot tread that we end up with like    antagonist who be all fight for screentime   it s such a mess    I like the idea of the story   the pitch   but it s so   unfocused   the writer keep move in circle and whenever it look like it s finally go somewhere they push the reset button   it drag on and on       hour in I hope it would finally pick up steam   the follow mission then have I press and hold a for    minute to deliver a letter     yeah    this go beyond a slow burn    it s a total timesink   waste your precious gaming hour with pointless fluff mission   and since play most of they isn t even fun to begin with   it add insult to injury    by the time I reach the second epilogue it have completely wear out its welcome        closing thought       I ve see people call the gameplay outdate   but if that be true the game would actually take those damn training wheel off    no   I d say this be peak   modern gaming     so hyper focus on presentation and be a movie it treat player as an inconvenience    r   fall so deep down the artsy fartsy hole   they d rather put you on a leash and yank it back so to preserve their precious grand design   and here ali I want be to play a fun cowboy game   they ve completely lose the plot and now I m actually concerned about gtavi    rdr   be stunningly beautiful   a technical marvel unparalleled in its attention to detail    and I d rather read the dictionary than ever play it again
I just go through a hurricane in appalachia   which be insane   after     day without power   I finally have it   I want to forget about this disaster and play a singleplayer game that I purchase and install on my steam deck   but   because I still don t have internet   I can t    I can t refund because I purchase it month ago        this online requirement to play single player game        rockstar   pirate the       out of this game
the game itself   phenomenal   amazing   truly a once in a lifetime game to experience that I think everyone should play through at least once   there s no game quite like it   play it on console when it first drop and decide to snag it on pc during a sale so I could experience it again but with     modding      why the negative review   then    the game not only require a   rd party account   that be rockstar game   but it also require you to download rockstar s game launcher to even play the dang thing   I don t like it when game link to your steam account not only require a separate   rd party account to be create   but an entirely separate launcher   too   what even be the point of it be on steam if you just have to install their separate launcher to even play it    also   why bother have red dead online on steam separately   if you can also just gain complete access to it by buy the base game itself   I kinda wish they sell online and solo player separately so I didn t need a whole other account and launcher and disc space for the online content that I m not particularly interested in
nereal            old town road xix     
hey mister  
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   I be unable to play on pc cause of some graphic driver issue   say driver be out of date but they be not    so refund it   though I have play on ps   previously    great game   gta be nothing in comparison   especially in term of its online mode   no         modder and even assume there be no modder on gta it d still beat it tenfold   offline mode s story be also just   far well and the gameplay be overall far well
I have a weird emotional connection with this game   one of the few game that make I tear up   it be a true masterpiece   everything from character   story   mechanic like fishing and hunting to music   graphic and detail be masterfully craft    nothing less expect from rockstar
red dead redemption    just absolutely floor I   the amazing graphic have I hook as soon this wonderful re creation of the wild west start   what do it for I though be the story itself   I think it s arguably not just one of my favourite story in a game but the good   I became so emotionally invest in arthur morgan and company   even the ending bring I to tear   not many game do that    then there s the open world   however   rockstar be able to make not only a sprawl map but one with detail that make it feel alive right down to the minute interaction   not some throw away npc   they feel like people you pass on the road all live their own life and tell story of other quest   the detail be incredible   it really feel like they create their own flesh out world    this be an easy        game for I   it s a sight and story you will never forget   one that act to raise the standard of what open world video game be capable of be
probably the great game of all time I remember get this game christmas       next to when this game first release on the xbox one honestly suprise that could even run it its take I probably around    or    year just to finish the game because I be so immerse by it its also the fact I want a pc that could run this game on the max graphic so I get the good immersion possible I have finally complete this game and I can say it be truly a masterpiece the story be top tier nothing beat it I really like the animation for kill its very fun to kill in it I can say that        game I would play again and its easily one take spot of favourite game of all time for the realism which I d say be perfect I like how they make it realistic but the gun not too realistic not too unrealistic to keep gameplay feel smooth very nice from you rockstar good job
I will make a very honest review for this wonderful game   when I first start the game I be really bored   there be no story   I didn t know the character and I couldn t fully understand the game yet   I die many time because I didn t know the game mechanic   but as I play the game I realize that it have a deep story   and I want it to never end   even though we define it as a video game   the game give you the opportunity to connect with the character and the world of the game   you can already understand how meticulously the game be prepare base on the town   shop   animal   voice over   dialogue   joke   celebration   you can t help but get carry away in this game where you feel like an old time cowboy   the sad   th episode towards the end   show the true face of many character and it be an annoying episode   especially arthur s death   it be really an unnecessary death so I feel like give the game a bad review   d   but it be impossible to give a bad review to this masterpiece   even if it end badly   I be afraid that the bad ending would come in the part we play with john   but thankfully it end well   it be a more relaxed part   we take care of the farm and our family   we meet our old friend again we take our revenge on those who betray we   and we learn that everything be actually our love one   it be a game that I be sad to see the end but I enjoyed play it a lot   and   this be a red dead redemption
I have at last stumble upon it the game that have render I speechless   the one that defy the very notion of be   review   but I shall try my good   red dead redemption    be not merely a video game   nor can it be simply categorise as entertainment   it transcend the bound of its medium in a way that few   if any   game have before   to call this experience the pinnacle of gaming be not to engage in hyperbole   but rather to acknowledge a simple truth   this be an achievement in storytelle   world building   and interactive design that rival and perhaps surpass some of the great work of art ever create by humankind    why be this the case   the reason be as numerous as they be profound   but at the heart of it all lie a narrative so finely craft   so intricate in its emotional and psychological depth   that it linger long after the final chapter be close   few story across any medium have manage to evoke the same range of emotion I feel while play red dead redemption     by the end   I wasn t just move   I be utterly shatter   reduce to an emotional wreck   the journey of arthur morgan   with all of its complexity and nuance   pull you into its orbit in a way that make you feel as if you be not just witness his story   but live it alongside he   the emotional weight of his journey and the moral dilemma he face feel not only real but consequential an effect that be rarely achieve even in the fine literature or cinema    then there be the gameplay   which   while it may take a bit of time to fully grasp especially for those like I who may not have be familiar with rockstar s game quickly become second nature   it be not just the control or mechanic that stand out   but the sense of presence and agency the game give you within its world   every decision   every movement feel deliberate and consider   this be a game that ask you to slow down   to immerse yourself   to appreciate the richness of your surrounding and the depth of its system   yes   there s a learn curve   but once you acclimate   you be reward with gameplay that be deeply engage   layer with meaningful interaction and choice   whether you re in the midst of an intense gunfight   manage your horse   or simply take a quiet ride through the wilderness   the game s mechanic ground you in the world   make every moment feel substantial    but what truly set red dead redemption    apart be the unparalleled level of attention to detail   the open world that rockstar have craft doesn t just feel vast it feel alive   it breathe   it pulse with the rhythm of daily life   and it convince you that it exist even when you be not there to witness it   from the bustling town to the remote wilderness   from the way animal behave in their natural habitat to the way npc go about their day   the world feel like a live ecosystem   every background character   no matter how minor   seem to have their own story   their own purpose   and this attention to even the small detail create an illusion of life that be nothing short of extraordinary   these character aren t just there to fill space they be integral to the world s immersion   each one contribute to the sense that you be part of something far large than yourself    to describe the environment in red dead redemption    be to attempt the impossible   word simply do not suffice   the landscape be not merely beautiful they be breathtake   whether it s the snow cap mountain   the vast open plain   or the dense   eerie swamp   every inch of this world have be painstakingly craft to perfection   the game s graphical fidelity be unmatched   but it s more than just technical prowess that make the environment so impactful   it s the way they evoke a sense of place   a sense of awe   stand atop a cliff   watch the sun dip below the horizon as the wind sweep through the grass below   you aren t just see a beautifully render landscape you be experience a moment of pure immersion that feel almost meditative   the beauty of the world draw you in   and it be impossible not to get lose in its vastness    and then there be the music   a vital part of the game s emotional fabric   the soundtrack   primarily compose by bill elm and woody jackson   be nothing short of sublime   over the past year   their composition have dominate my spotify listening habit   and for good reason   the music in red dead redemption    doesn t just serve as background noise it elevate the entire experience   whether you re embark on a narrative drive mission   where the score swell in dramatic fashion   or simply ride across the countryside with nothing but the sound of your horse s hoof and a melody in the air   the music perfectly complement the game s atmosphere   the way it blend seamlessly with both the grandiose and quieter moment of the game be nothing short of masterful   it add an emotional layer to an already rich experience   draw you even deeply into the world and its character    in all my year of play video game   start from the tender age of five when I first hold a controller in my hand and boot up a game on a ps one   I have never encounter anything that compare to red dead redemption     this game be   in every sense of the word   perfect   the narrative   the gameplay   the environment   the music every piece fit together in a way that feel effortless   create an experience that be not only unparalleled but likely unrepeatable   it be   quite simply   the most extraordinary video game I have ever play   and it have set a standard for what be possible in this medium and hasn t be trump in the last    year of it s existence   it s just that sublime       depressed cowbous out of    
the good story drive game I ve ever play   this game put incredible focus on small detail   make it feel almost flawless   with a few mod to enhance quality like add even more detail or a graphic overhaul it easily become a        experience   even without mod   it s still outstanding   the storytelling be a perfect         the side story be a solid         and the emotional impact be off the chart at             everything about this game deserve high praise   but that end really get I   thank you   rockstar   for an incredible experience    edit    the ending be beautiful
superb   even after      hour play   I still discover new thing   a game that capture you completely   non repetitive mission   excellent   you can also write a book to describe in detail any aspect of this game   the graphic   the atmosphere   the music   the light     a movie
I cry like everyone else   online can be pretty fun too   just don t spend any real money

take about    year of slowly   happily chip away at this gargantuan behemoth of a western odyssey   and when I finally get to the end   I feel a genuine sense of awe at what I just witness    arthur morgan be so astonishingly well write   and perform   as a main character   I find it hard to think of any other video game protagonist who come close to reach the level achieve here    the open world detail be so absurdly well realize   the sheer volume of work that go into this game be mind boggle    the music be fantastic   the combat be superb   customize your arsenal of weapon and your horse be awesome   the atmosphere of every region of the world be distinct and different   the weather system be incredible   every saloon   hotel   shop and homestead be meticulously detail    the random interaction with npc   the excellently perform conversation and side character at your camp   the sheer volume of voice dialogue in this game be astonish    hunting animal   take on bounty   playing poker and get into drunken fist fight at the saloon   just remarkable    the story itself be incredible   and worth see through to the very end   that mean finish the two epilogue chapter   it be absolutely       worth the wait and payoff    just an astonishing masterpiece and rockstar s good game as far as I m concerned   love the gta series   they re awesome    but this be on another level    massive recommendation   superb game

story spoiler be at the end of the review with spoiler tag on they   if you haven t play the game   don t even check what s hide behind they      this one have to be the hard game to review for I   I really enjoy every other aspect of the game but the gameplay   which make it hard to recommend this   once again   would love to give this a mixed rating because of that   but the story make it worth a while   even though I literally have to force myself to continue play at time   I ll first give a review on everything else without spoiler   and leave the story itself for the end    tl dr overall        story         very enjoyable and interesting   but find it too predictable with a weird pacing   mission         some great one for sure   but      of the mission follow the same exact formula   make the game very boring to play   combat         didn t really suck but for I the combat be plain boring   world         beautiful with diverse area   just didn t really see the need for open world in this game   character          just amazing   love every single character in their own way    since most of the positive be in the story itself   I ll start with focus on stuff that I didn t really enjoy     travel around the world   I be not a fan of ride the horse   the control be okay   but sometimes turn or jump over obstacle be wonky   I wouldn t really mind it   but the way the game be build make it so most of the time you be just ride the horse   and don t even get I start on the slow ahh carriage   then I find out about fast travel   since it wasn t really that clear from the beginning   maybe I miss some pop up   tutorial   for it     use it a couple of time since I just couldn t be arse to ride all around the map   well   in the end stop use it because it be too much of a hassle to set up a camp or go to a fast travel point   I didn t really see a point in that   since you be get a cutscene of ride there anyways   couldn t you just ride without a fast travel point       combat do not feel rewarding in the slight   I dunno what it be   but I just wasn t hit my shot lmao   I aim to the head   dot be red   press m    I miss the shot   feel like the combat be design around dead eye   with dead eye activate   it be alright   but it kinda take I away from the immersion   this be especially true for any horseback fight   and on move target   also I never get use to pull my weapon out from the horse s bag   so I barely even use the sniper shotgun I have     the mission be repetitive   there be some that I find cool   but honestly   almost all of they work the exact same way      ride to location a     talk to someone     ride to location b     plan go wrong     shoot everyone     ride away this be cool for some story moment   but this alone be the main reason I just couldn t play much at once     side content wasn t really worth it   I do do all the side quest and bounty I get   and enjoy a handful of they   most of they do feel like straight up filler with just more add riding to the game   I barely even touch the open world stuff   like legendary animal or different robbery   the few that I do do didn t really hit I and just want to get through the game some day    now it s time for the story   this section contain so beware for those
great story
this game change my life       instant    star   nothing more need to be say
stop look at bad review and play this magnificent game already   it have the good story out of any single player game I have ever play   now go play this game
obviously the great game of all time
play this game originally when it come out in           year later it still manage to blow I away with its insane graphic and one of the good story tell in any video game   truly a masterpiece
       good rockstar game I ve ever play   a must buy      game be fun   addicting and the story be phenomenal   drain almost      hour out of I and I still have so much leave to explore
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    here I will leave this beautiful capybara   whoever pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up   I need steam point
   one of the great game of modern age   the graphic be stunning   compelling story   the game feel so alive
I don t want a separate launcher for every single game I play   I just want to play the singleplayer mode and I can not even launch the game
story mode be fine but online be full of modder   I swear   launch a trader s delivery and    second       boom it s blow   everything you work for for hour be lose      don t play online   period   it s a joke
top    game in history
rockstar launcher lock I out of my copy because its attach to an account with an email I can t access and rockstar win t unlink my account   rediculous
shove your piece of       launcher deep in your arse and       off
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   rockstar be useless   I create a rockstar account in       with gta   because I don t have the same email   and no access to the original email address through an internet provider   they cancel the email when you switch service    I be tell that I can never play another rockstar game through steam   so   from someone that have buy every gta since it be on nintendo   goodbye
there s just nothing like it out there   I ve complete this game for the   th time already and during those year I haven t come across a game that compare to it   red dead redemption    be not a game for I   it s a journey you take with arthur and with every journey with he I just can t let my honor go below the negative threshold   you know you care about a character that much that the thought of murder every npc you meet at west elizabeth seldom come to your mind   everything about this game be just delightful perfection   a true potent american venom when it comes deliver a gaming experience that will surely be embed in your heart and mind after a playthrough
this game be red dead redemption     yo no way   a western style game where you can choose to be more passive or full blow criminal   you can rob train which will give you more money to give to the camp   in story mode   the story mode aspect of red dead redemption    be my personal favorite   the storyline be great and I haven t even complete it yet
love the game on playstation   the game look great on pc   however   rockstar seem to give up on it   I don t care for the politic or excuse as to why they divert focus or interest   I do take issue with folk that just want to play a quality game that they pay good money for   probably more than once   only to have it die across all platform    gta have always have small improvement or addition make to it   this game should have have the same attention
the game itself deserve a recommendation   while some mechanic and design choice be somewhat half bake or even outdate   the game have solid writing   amazing graphic   sound and meticulously craft world with it s innumerable detail   it s pack to the brim with atmosphere   the open world and side content be my favorite game play wise   as story mission tend to funnel the player into very strict boundary on how to achieve whatever need to be do   no experience with red dead online    the real beef which I wish to address be with the mandatory   rockstar social   always online component    and the account tie to it   please   I m just try to enjoy an asocial single player experience   anyhow   this software tumor nearly prevent I from play this game that I have pay for    I can t verify some detail as rockstar never explain what happen   but in essence   they have my steam account link to an rockstar social account   that be supposedly register to my defunct email address    which have be go for year   it shouldn t have be possible as rdr   be my first rockstar game since gta     and that wasn t always online   steam refund window be already close   so I have to climb obstacle and jump through flame hoop to get my steam account unlinked and then relinked to my current email address   this whole ordeal take day overall   and be a stark reminder of always online single player requirement be cancer    and I refuse to buy any of it s ilk from now on   even if such game could rival rdr   in quality   the few service outage   which also prevent I from play this game be the cherry on top of this decision    tl dr   game good   always online bad   make your own educate decision
singleplayer be great   can highly recommend   multiplayer be plague by hacker and griefer
force I to download the rockstar client and require my email   let I play the game   you get my money
one of the good game ever make
may I stand unshaken amid   amidst a crash world
good game lock behind a       launcher
never be a big fan of cowboy and old western type of story but I get really immerse in this one and it have I cry in the end   very good game   arthur morgan and his family will stay forever in my heart
its impossible to describe this game in simple word   its the good thing I ve ever play   wherever you go   there will be some kind of content relate to increase or decrease honor   honestly   after go through the game for all the achievement   there be no such feeling that I have study the full game   I want to go in search of something new again and again   I can not say anything about online   like norm   but like sh t
I can t believe this game be already    year old   game be way ahead of its time   the real aaa game   the story   the character   the graphic   the audio   the voice act   the world     it s all incredibly immersive   I feel like I live through arthur s and john s journey   my advice to play this game be don t rush to finish the game   take your time and enjoy the world what its offer since this game be really huge
good game ever make   still nothing can beat this    year later   good story   good character   good protagonist antagonist depend on how you feel like roll with arthur   good dialogue   well hide dialogue   well open world with hide encounter   and list go on
   one of my favorite game     
rockstar add anti cheat after     year and remove the ability to play rdr online on    liunx steamdeck macos via parallel macos via crossover   or equivalent    thank
I ve have to torrent a game I own because of the rockstar launcher   would not recommend
you must install an additional launcher to read this review
why do I have to have an internet connection to play single player
ye
great game   but a glitch that I m always stick in the stable and never can leave it or play the game with my horse anymore   play for hour on xbox   pc just suck
      system   if you lose access to or delete the email originally associate with rockstar game launcher   you will lose total access to the game as the game remains link to steam and therefore unable to   create a new account   for the game to access   and nobody will help you out with this
in my opinion   the good way to experience red dead redemption    be to play it twice   for the first playthrough   dive into the story and play however you want blindly   without consult reddit   youtube   or guide   focus on immerse yourself in arthur s journey without overthinke it   once you finish the story and feel satisfied   step away for a while   play something else   let the experience settle   and clear your mind    then   when you re ready   return to rdr   for a second playthrough   this time   take it slow   spend time in camp   interact with the character   and soak in the everyday moment   listen to the camp s complaint   celebration   and gossip   you ll find a world that feel alive   with detail that be easy to miss the first time   since you already know the story   you can now focus on the small thing maybe try different approach to situation or explore the outdoor as a frontier simulator    at the time of write   I ve spend around      hour in the game   my first playthrough be on stadia   clock about      hour   and I be captivate by the world rockstar create   after upgrade to a pc   lot of wait and save money     year later to be exact   also rip stadia    I start a second playthrough   this time with a slow   more deliberate approach   now   I m spend more time with the camp interaction   hunting   and explore   in my first run   I feel I rush through some of the more personal and rich interaction   miss a lot of side activity like craft and collectible   but in this current playthrough   I m finally able to fully appreciate the depth and detail of the world and realize just how much I d overlook the first time
I can t play the        game because the launcher keep ask I to log in to rockstar   I only have one account   but I keep get this error     this steam account be already link to another rockstar game account   please log in with that account     go       yourself    I instal the game use the rockstar launcher and play for about    hour   but it be a mess   mission    be completely bug     npc be stick   I go to kill they   then other show up   so I go after they   only for the mission to fail because I be   too far away      lol    dutch keep getting kill   I ve try to complete this mission    time   but it just win t let I pass     I give up        on steam   lol   that suck ass
life change experience
honestly rockstar   damn you and your devs for forget about one of your game and let people ruin other   gaming experience
   this be probably the good game I have ever play in the history of forever and ever
be emotionally prepared

absolutely beautiful game on pc   and the insane level of detail in the world be incredible   although rockstar s mission design have be show its age for over a decade now   this be pretty much the pinnacle of the r   formula   at least until gta vi come out   it s cliche   but the world feels   live in    and when you set off to do something   you ll frequently be distract by thing that occur along the way   many of they happen organically   or in way that at least feel as such    grand theft horse get throw around a lot   and on the surface   it s true   but rdr   have a distinct atmosphere that set it apart from the gta series   arthur morgan be far and away the good protagonist in rockstar history   and rank highly among video game protagonist in general   he s a flawed anti hero   and your play style and decision making determine just how flawed he be    if the set appeal to you   and you like the rockstar design philosophy   you ll like this   and I would venture to say that even if the set doesn t initially appeal to you   it s still worth try
   well open world game I ever play    this game should be in everyone library
this be just one of the good game I ve ever play   there be nothing else that need to be say
beautiful   heart wrench   and amazing
game          suck because of rockstar not let I play it   such a          shame
all you have to do be follow the damn plan   arthur
very good
damn
woah cowboy
I find myself wonder if there will ever be a game like this again   five year after its release   I finally decide to play rdr    I m glad I wait and I m sad it s over    three month and      hour later   I have finish the main storyline   after the main character s story   just as you think you ve finish the game   the epilogue begin   basically a whole quarter of the map unlock at this point   leave you feel like you still have so much more to do and explore    will I play it again   probably not    the experience be so mind blow   I feel like a second playthrough may ruin it   I want to continue look back fondly on the experience   perhaps someone will convince I otherwise     with this game   a second playthrough could be a wholly unique experience    the game be huge   the story be long   this be not an action game   it s a life simulator   I haven t even log into red dead online yet     apparently there s a whole single player campaign in the as well   never mind the multiplayer element   perhaps I ll come back and edit this after having give red dead online a proper go     the writing be phenomenal   the character have real depth   yes   most of they be psychotic criminal   that s okay   moral ambiguity be a central theme   if all your life you grow up only learn how to survive by commit crime   at which point do you begin to question your way of life   when the law start come after you   of course   you realize then that your way of life be not normal   you be confront with change and a massive moral dilemma   can a criminal also be a good person   if so   how   by be a robin hood or by figure out a way to go straight    these be just some of the interesting plot element the player be present with throughout the rich   entertaining   sometimes funny   sometimes sad   all too human story    the graphic be stunning   the animation be generally spot on   although there be some place where the animator clearly cut corner   nevertheless   everything generally look and feel realistic   the sound design be masterful    the game be fun   not altogether challenge   but hardly ever bore   the pace can be quite slow   especially at the beginning   the game teach you to appreciate the little moment   stop and take in the scenery   stop and listen in on a random conversation between stranger   pull over and explore something that look interesting from a distance   the world be alive and inherently open to the player s input   it demand that you take interest in it   as you would in the real world without screen and tech   it be not design to be speedran   it be design to be mindfully appreciate   the game encourage you to play it in a non perfectionist manner   do not try to min max it   yes   you can go for       completion rate   but first   you need to play it   treat it as you would your own life   no take back   deal with the consequence of your action   make peace with the fact that accident happen   learn from your mistake and the randomness of a chaotic world    yes   there be bug   many of they   expect to see horse clip through people   expect to see people stick on top of building   expect the map to behave badly   expect mission to bug out   I run into one bug that cause I to lose all of my money   upwards of         which be quite a lot in this game    that s okay   I be willing to look past the imperfection of this game   because the experience be unparalleled     it s worth every cent and every minute of playtime   if you haven t play it yet   what be you do   this be probably the good game ever create   game developer will have a difficult time top it   at least for the next     year   the attention to detail and the sense of   everything come together   be something truly special     a collaboration between brilliant mind that only happen once in a lifetime
I never review game   I be far too lazy   but   I feel I must leave this review here for anyone have any doubt that they need to experience this game    this be the most in depth   well write   expansive game I have ever play   you feel the emotion of the gang you be run with   I ve develop deep emotion for these character I haven t feel since halo reach   I literally stop play this game for year because I didn t want to see these character   story end   well do to rockstar for the care they put into this and well do to the community for always give this the flower it deserve   also       dutch van der linde   
it s be a long time since a game truly move I it take I    attempt to finish it first two time   I didn t even bother play more than    hour and now   look back   I m really glad   it help I a lot get through the darkest and most painful moment of my life each time I pick it up   it remind I   it help I survive the hopelessness that still feel endless I play it when die feel easy than live perhaps that s why it hold such a heavy place in my heart right now play and finish this game mark those moment moment of those suffocate   tear soak night it s a reminder of when I feel like give up on everything   now with the game complete   I ask myself what now    I want to believe thing will get well   even if it s hard to imagine right now even if light seem so distant and faint   I will try to hold on to my fragile hope   I will really miss you more than I will be ever able to express   goodbye rdr

red dead redemption    be a masterpiece that set a new standard for open world game   the sheer scale and detail of its world be nothing short of breathtake   from the bustling town to the serene wilderness   every corner of the map be meticulously craft   make exploration a joy in itself    the attention to detail be astounding   whether it s the dynamic weather system   the realistic animal behavior   or the intricate character interaction   everything feel alive and immersive   the game world react to your action in way that make it feel truly live in and authentic    the story be compelling   fill with memorable character and emotional moment that keep you invest from start to finish   the side mission and random encounter add depth and variety   ensure there s always something new to discover    overall   red dead redemption    be not just a game   it s an experience   its immense open world and unparalleled attention to detail make it a must play for any fan of the genre
when I finish this game      it be almost midnight   I be in a dark room with just the light of the monitor   just take it all in be very emotional and I m not an emotional person   this game have what I consider to be one of   it not the   great story in any video game   it s on par with some great hollywood film   you actually connect with the character   there be twist and turn   the story make sense   the graphic be wonderful   the gameplay be amazing   it s a solid   and I mean solid

arthur morgan I love you

great singleplayer story   terrible online experience   every lobby have a minimum of one hacker if you re lucky   do anything online be a hassle   can t recommend because hacker literally run the server   god mode   fly   spawn any object character   your include    teleportation   custom animation   etc etc   if you try to fight against the hacker they just resort to crash your fps game whichever come first
you re a good man   arthur morgan
hell yeah brother
rockstar launcher force itself upon you and your pc in order to run the game   rockstar launcher force its own recommend game setting upon your save file and refuse to let you change they   consistently revert back to its recommend setting after you ve save they   rockstar launcher override any read only setting you set for the setting file so you can t override its recommend setting or stop it from revert your setting back to its recommend setting   the game be force I to play with invert control and various graphic setting that I want to turn off   game be entirely unplayable in this state   and rockstar support be of absolutely zero help       star because the game be completely unplayable until they decide to fix it
we need more money
I imagine myself as a       s one direction fan girl for arthur morgan   didn t finish the prologue bc I miss bro too much
goat      good game I ever play    
all we have to do be get more money orthor
the good game
this review reflect my personal feeling as a player who hasn t play the first red dead redemption game and didn t have any expectation go in   the game be quite long in term of story   take I around     hour to complete   but I don t regret a single hour spend   this game be absolutely worth it   here be my thought on the main aspect of the game       story the story in red dead redemption    be long   grip   and full of twist   take I about     hour to complete   each chapter bring something new   keep the experience fresh and engage   the plot introduce we to a wide range of character   each with their own personality and background   which give the story depth but also require careful attention   there be so many character to keep track of that it s essential to pay attention to their role   as some name can easily start to blend together   watch arthur morgan   the main protagonist   navigate complex relationship and situation be one of the good part of the story   this journey be full of emotional moment   unexpected turn   and intense scene that keep I hooked from begin to end       gameplay the gameplay be incredibly smooth   with a wide selection of weapon to choose from   range from revolver and rifle to bow   the control feel responsive   and explore the vast open world be satisfy and immersive   there s a realistic sense of variety in what you can do from hunt animal to discover random camp and visit bustling town   the world feel alive with detail   like diverse animal to hunt   item to sell   and dynamic weather and landscape   one good feature be the craft system   where you can create your own specialized ammunition   like fire arrow and explosive bullet   as well as health item to aid you in survival   this add another layer of customization to how you approach different situation and fight   one small downside   however   be the horseback riding   which can be a bit clunky   sometimes the horse change direction unexpectedly or trip over small object instead of leap over they   despite this   the gameplay be highly enjoyable and full of option that make every hour in the game worthwhile       graphic I have never play a game that be so graphically and visually detail   even though the game have be out for a few year   it still look well than many new game   I often spend hour just walk through forest   watch or hunt animal   and admire the beautiful scenery   the environment   weather effect   and character animation be breathtakingly realistic   make the game feel immersive       achievement I love collect achievement in game   and because red dead redemption    be such an excellent game   I aim to get as many achievement as possible   with so many type of animal   it take I dozen of hour to track   study   and skin they all to earn certain achievement   even though these achievement take a long time to complete   I enjoy every moment   however   there be a few achievement that be simply grindy rather than challenge or fun   for example   the story mode have an achievement that require you to kill and skin     bear   which become more of a tedious task   the online achievement have similar issue   like need to own five horse   which cost around         in game currency   give that mission only reward around      each   this achievement can be frustratingly grindy       online mode the online mode be disappointing   which isn t surprising consider rockstar s history with online game   mission be repetitive   and high level player often target new   low level player   make the experience frustrating   additionally   the server be unstable   and the game crash frequently   in my opinion   red dead redemption    online be a fail addition to an otherwise amazing game    final thought in conclusion   I thoroughly enjoy play red dead redemption     the story   gameplay   graphic   and achievement   despite a few frustration   make it an outstanding game   though the online mode be disappointing   the single player experience alone be well worth it        
spoiler   chap    its           windiiiiiiiiiii chap    lennyyyyyyyy chap    cotton chap    aligator chap    be this          tahiti   chap    turbeculosis epilouge    milking cow epilouge    milk my own cow
nothing like it that I ve play   
despite other thing   its chill to just camp   hunting and fishing
top    game all time   good main character all time   top    open world all time   mid mission design   mid combat   red dead online be genuinely a disaster   do not play it under any circumstance I beg of you          
en son hayatta kalma m cadelesi veriyordum    imdi k y evinde      temizliyorum
       tahitian mango farming simulator
   please take this review as a mix review   the storyline be amazing and it be a beautiful game that u can get lose in it for hour if u like cowboy and indian stuff it s also a very good game for role play in redm   however red dead regular online have a moding hack problem and I find it very hard and very annoying to play when u have a moder hacker that can not seem to mind their own business since rockstar doesn t update up their security as much as console get it s already hard enough that the game be very grindy and every role cause gold bar and u don t get pay in gold bar with mission that rockstar have u only get nugget just to get the one role that s like     to     or more and it take u hour and hour just to afford one role each   especially when the game do not get update that it need or no new content   and the game have so much untouched potential that it can be amazing game if it wasn t so neglect and for the moder hacker that just ruin red dead online   if I have to rate it for story mod        must play for online        for redm to role play in      
good game rockstar ever make
that really be a shame to play as a sick person   since his return from sea   will he be sick till the end of game
goate game
it s impossible to describe how good this game be   one thing I could say about it be that it literally change my viewpoint on life and make I understand many thing in life   it make I a well man   this game have make I go from tear to laugh to pure joy        there be nothing to fill the void this game leave I after I beat it
""
      
I ve hear some people say this be the good game of all time   I think there s a reasonable argument to be make for that
good story ever
I wanna watch they cowboy movie now
the good story game I ve ever play   its incredibly immersive   the story be a roller coaster ride of emotion   and it feel like you re actually live in the game
yes

this be the definition of the   perfect game   to I   it ll be my favorite game of all time   thank rockstar to make red dead redemption    and thank god
I like this product
   very good game and I really enjoy it
one of the heavily detailed game I ve play in a while         taa
honestly   one of the good videogame in all history   but at my opinion   it s the good game ever do   the story   graphic   gameplay   and the character   I never see a protagonist so human like arthur morgan   if you see this game on discount and your hardware can run it   buy it   you win t regret it
amazing writing on the main story   do not expect this to be a game that make I cry   but it be   the ending be          beautiful   this be also a great game for if you want to escape your life for a while and just go bird watch on a mountaintop   in my current playthrough   I ve leave micah in jail for the last     hour while I track down dinosaur bone   I m have the time of my life
red dead redemption    be nothing short of a masterpiece in the world of gaming   develop by rockstar game   it offer an immersive experience that set new standard for open world adventure   weave together a beautifully craft narrative   unforgettable character   and stunning visual
   I lovee lovee this game so much     I recommend it to everyone     the graphic    the open world map    the amount of thing and people you can interact with    the character    the weapon    everything be just amazing     this be one of the good game I ve ever play and I really wish that I could play it for the very first time again      also I would like to give a special thank you too rictronator and berry chan for choose I as their winner from their giveaway    group    anti social outcast    and gift I this game for free       I be soo gratefull     get this game

cowboy
  
I ve play a lot of game for a long time this one be most impressive   and be a     year old man that grow up in the day of cowboy and indian movie    show I tell you if we have this to play as well those time would never have die and be just as popular today   I think I know a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game have teach I even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that need to be explore   this be the first red dead game I have play and I just start play it a few day ago and can hardly stop each day and can t wait to get back to it be the good compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mention   you don t know what your miss until you try it   everything be truly alive from the people in the town to the animal and wild life and the horse you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their life with or without you   the story you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well write and entertaining as well as the music in the background or be play by people around you   so much to experience and explore it s unbelieveable    take the time to watch the world around you see the eagle and hawk swoop down and grab a rabbit run or a fish out of the water or see the vulture and crow and raven come and feed off a kill   see the fish jump for bug or the cyottie or a fox chase down and kill an animal    and see the human ugliness as well of the time the start of the kkk after the civil war the burning of cross s and slave quarter and poor area outside of town for black of the time outside of the plantation of the south    the attention to detail be off the scale the sound and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too    choose the man you want to be even as an outlaw a heart of gold or a man of evil   either way take it all in or you have miss what have be create here a master piece    edit   they say you can finish this game in     hour of play I have over      hour now and say I be not do yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from npc random conversation and hide thing to find and do   just remember one thing these time be brutal and hard   this be an honest depiction story of the time so expect your heart string to be pull this be not a story book end from disney   cowboy s ride hard   die young and fast and rarely do greed   revenge and murder go unpunished or be easily forget   with the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seem so much small and a lot hard to hide from the law
howdy partner
I love it
r   seriously rdr   and undead nightmare for       be you all high over there yeah this be rdr    but I m not buy a     year old game with a slight remaster for      base and       for the one extra piece of side content   hold on to your nutz everyone gta   be go to be       for single player and a monthly subscription of      when online come out a year and a half later   those pos shark card will cost another       for the       card now      just       off already r   I m root for your failure now I just see they have re    on sale for      game be what maybe a year old now   and this isn t the first time it be on sale either   and yet to replay over a decade old game you be pay more than double that   x that if you slob r   southern door handle for undead     ps jasonchao canada     hrs post   october     the good open world game   try it      dollar be just worth it   even it be      dollar   I will still buy it   this these clown be the problem   rdr   be a great game but not that good everything be rinse and repeat before you be      if not      of the way through if this game didn t have event interesting enough or even place to take scenic walk that take your mind off of how much time you be actually waste do mindless wandering around you loose the gun and this be exactly that a walk horse simulator   also the actor absolutely kill but ill be damned if I be throw more of my money at suit and milestone bonus for upper management

my review   I highly recommend this game   if you re on the fence and question whether it s worth the price yes   one thousand time yes   it s without a doubt my favorite open world game   offer beautiful landscape   an interesting story   well craft character   a soul stir soundtrack   and hour of engage content    I ve experience red dead redemption    four time twice on my ps   and twice on my computer   each playthrough be a unique experience tie to specific period of my life   when I reflect on those time   one of the thing that always come to mind be   that   particular playthrough of rdr    I remember the specific story that I would share with my friend of what I experience or the many moment in game that bring I back from a bad day   it s truly one of the good escape and experience out there    I have very few complaint about the base game itself   however   I be less forgiving when it come to the online portion   I go into the online content understand that it have pretty well be abandon   and like an old shack   there s not much to do after a certain point   while it s very possible to enjoy the online content   especially   posse ing   up with friend   which I do find fun    it doesn t hold your attention long enough to keep you come back   most of my online time be in full service of achievement hunting   I have a goal in mind   once I reach that goal   I find it difficult to stay engaged   the story mode keep you immerse effortlessly   but stick with the online content   especially in the early stage   can be a challenge   I don t believe rdr s mechanic and foundation translate as well to online when compare to grand theft auto and its online counterpart    while I didn t give red dead redemption online much love   I can t express enough how much I adore the story mode and base game   if you re willing to read it   my personal experience with the game show just how much I love the story mode in red dead redemption      my personal experience   in my first playthrough on the ps    shortly after the game s release   I have just undergo a major dental operation and decide it be time to dive into red dead redemption     as with any first playthrough   it be a learn experience   and it be a rough one   I miss several prompt tell I what control be what   and in such a massive game   I naturally feel lose   however   as the story progress   so do my skill as a virtual gunslinger   interestingly   my interest in the game fade near the start of chapter two   it wasn t until three or so month later that I return to finish the story   at that time   I never fully experience everything the game have to offer just the story    it wasn t until my second playthrough   still on the ps    that I really get my bearing   I understand the gameplay well and start incorporate role play element   like make sure arthur eat and get his rest   even as I stay up until    a m     most importantly   I make it my mission to       the game   separate from achieve       of the steam achievement    I m proud to say I do thank in part to be send home due to the pandemic   in the darkness of the pandemic   a light I find be that mission to        which be make even well by late night conversation with my friend    fast forward another year   and I decide to get rdr   on steam   it be this decision that lead to a new mission   to       not just the game   but all of its steam achievement   know it wouldn t be easy   I make sure not to put any pressure on myself or set any deadline   it be mean to be a casual pursuit until it wasn t   story mission by story mission   I gradually collect the passive achievement until I have complete the story for the third time   but that s where it end   for now   my interest in the mission have admittedly got overtake by other priority    the mission lay dormant   with a few less notable outing   until nearly three year later when I return to my favorite game   this time   I not only want to replay the story but also continue my progress from my third playthrough   in this new   fourth playthrough   I decide to take an evil approach to the story   but that didn t last long for two reason   first   at a certain point in the game   it just feel wrong   like I be betray a character I d know for so long   I ll leave it at that to keep the experience as vague as possible for new player   second   and more importantly   I accidently delete my third playthrough from my computer   a lesson for everyone   use the numerous save slot to make multiple save of your playthrough   and do not accidently overwrite the only save you have with a new playthrough save    this fourth playthrough be by far the most extensive   and intense in the good way possible   while I continue incorporate my favorite element from my second playthrough   role play   I be still determined to       complete both the base game and the steam achievement   what concern I the most be the online portion   everything else   with enough time and commitment   I know I could handle   but some of the online achievement   which require multiple player or competitive element   have I worry   and base on what I d hear about red dead redemption online   those concern weren t alleviate any    without go too deep into my achievement hunt   the two achievement I want to highlight for two different reason be   grin and bear it   and   the real deal    to put it simply   I hate   grin and bear it    it can go to hell   while on the other hand    the real deal    which be my big concern among the online achievement   turn out to be surprisingly easy   my tip for those seek this achievement   stay in the same lobby game as long as possible   eventually   the player count will drop   give you a well chance to earn the mvp title    after a lengthy journey fill with up and down   I finally achieve       completion in the base game and among the steam achievement on august            this adventure not only deepen my appreciation for red dead redemption    but have also truly be a highlight of my gaming experience

I have a rtx       with   gb vram   amd ryzen        h and     gb of ram and somehow I can not play this game what the       so ever   I start the story and right the       away I end up with    fps as it s show piece of text       I don t know if there s a fix for this   I ve try what reddit have suggest and other site alike        do not help   it piss I off as this be one of my favorite game of all time and I can t even enjoy it on pc whereas on xbox I can        s ridiculous   go into document folder to remove certain file that be say to       up the setting fps and even afterwards it s still the same dogwater fps    if anyone get a fix for it   let I know   for now I uninstalle it and I m just do    feed up of this        thank rockstar for introduce we to an amazing game but provide piss poor performance
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   do not buy rdr   here   it cost too much u can get it from other platform for      of this price      this be what happen with steam version of rdr   to I   I have a big problem with rdr   from steam because I also have other rockstar game from steam through the rockstar launcher   so I couldn t save the first mission or turn on autosave   the whole game be very laggy and it look really strange   I refund it on steam   my money be return    after I buy rdr   on another platform for literally a fraction of the price of what steam charge   everything work without a problem   steam support be completely unsupported   they just say they couldn t do anything about it   I deal with it for several day with rockstar support because steam support do nothing   and finally I be tell that for any game on steam from rockstar that require rockstar launcher   steam re download all profile and the entire rockstar game folder   so due to the fact that I have gta   on the c drive and rdr   on the d drive   the whole rockstar game folder   all the profile be download again and it bug and destroy the whole rdr   game    so     I don t recommend buy this game here   if u have some more rockstar game with rockstar launcher
simply a masterpiece      out of       I m write this review right after finish the story and I haven t experience so many emotion from a game in a long time   it s hard to believe that in       the game didn t get the well deserve goty title    the open world be simply stunning   with intricate detail in each little element    you will come across so many event   mission and encounter along the way   in my      hour in the open world   I miss an incredible amount of content    the atmosphere of the western be convey excellently   america at the end of the    th century   you feel the outlaw era come to an end and a new age dawn    a time of change and the decline of the wild age    as for the graphic   they be amazing   yes   there be rare moment of texture loading problem or some minor   blurry   spot   but I encounter these moment so rarely that they didn t affect the overall quality at all    of course   I be excited about the gameplay   as I mention before   the open world be full of activity   shootout   robbery   fishing   hunting and much more   the only thing that bother I a bit be that I see xbox controller prompt when play on the dualsense   but I find a fix for it so it be just a minor problem    and of course the story   I just want to say one thing here      the story begin with what appear to be a simple arc in the snowy mountain   but then evolve with each subsequent chapter    valentine   clemen point   saint denis   guarma   beaver hollow     and finally the epilogue with john   each arc become more intense and dramatic   we see each member of the gang change   dutch grow crazy with each fail plan   sadie become strong and braver while molly lose her love   kieran find his place in the gang and storm cloud gather over micah   and most important be arthur morgan s journey to and self realization    the soundtrack be also worth mention   take   for example   the unshaken track that play when arthur return from guarma     and that sunrise   the music   and that chilling moment                                                                                                                                                                         goty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            xix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         dualsense                                     xbox                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              unshaken

great atmosphere and story but there be major problem   first of all the control be almost game breaking   complicated and clumsy and especially the combat be clunky   you re not control a character but back up a     wheeler   second   too much combat   no matter what the mission   what setup and what goal the mission always end in a shootout where you kill hundred of guy   it do not matter if a quest be for a carton of milk or a bank robbery   you re always force to shoot dozen of opponent   fortunately game give you a skip option after you have a die few time that I end up use lot more than I expect   simple control and a lot less but polished combat would have make this a masterpiece   as be it fall short
    get the hell out of here and be a man
perfect   what more be there to say
one of the good story drive game of the last ten year   a must have and a must play

good game ever make in open world type
red dead redemption    be a breathtaking experience   amazing story   unforgettable character   and a stunning open world   a must play for all gamer   even if the control can feel clunky   especially during intense moment   and the slow pacing might frustrate some player   inventory management can be cumbersome too   despite these issue   the amazing world and story make it worth it

to I   rockstar games be a weird studio   they make game that sell really well   and receive nomination for so many award   yet still remain underwhelming in perception   grand theft auto v be an example of this    it s a fun game   especially play with friend    it s just   weird that it get so big    I think red dead redemption    would be another gta v   I be so wrong    I don t tend to play long   story drive   cinematic video game often   so a lot of they go under my radar   this game be no exception   I d like to thank my friend for encourage   force    I to play it   and other like it   please see      I win t lie and say this game be perfect   there be a lot of bit about that annoy I   especially early on   for example   rockstar continue to make game for pc that be obvious port of the console release   this game isn t as bad as be in this regard   but it be noticeable    it be worth say that you do not need a controller to play this game   the ui be just build with a console first outlook    not only this   but there be moment where the immersion falter slightly    like when you re travel with npc and movement become a whole lot less intuitive   or when cinematic often lead to buggy model interact with each other due to render they in the game s engine    now with the entire story under my belt   I can say that these be the only issue I have with the game   three extremely minor problem that you can    and will   as you play    see past   time to talk about the good stuff   where do I even begin     I ve play a lot of game in my time   and still know that I can say with confidence that arthur morgan be the good protagonist I ve ever have the pleasure of control   the relationship in his life   his outlook on the outlaw way of live   his strength   his flaw   his moral    you learn all about these and more   as well as how they evolve   and often devolve   throughout the course of this     hour   grip   heart wrench   and unparalleled story   you really end up want to make the most respectable choice for he   because you know how it will affect those he love and those who love he    even the small detail about his character be particularly touch   he interact with minor character in respectful way that other character don t even try to   he always care for his family in way that other character fail to   and he love in way we don t see other character do   you can even read the journal he write in    I use this as a recap of what happen during my previous session   as you play the game   his handwriting and illustration skill improve over time as he gain more experience with these creative outlet   he really be write to feel like a natural human being    I mention want to make the most respectable decision on arthur s behalf   do you know the game change depend on how honourable you act   cutscene   cinematic   and choice be unique to high and low honour    for the new player   sake   I win t get into specific   but this be a clear sign of a well written and immersive story    when I play video game   I often don t notice most of the soundtrack unless it s point out to I in the moment   this isn t the case for a score or specific song that be closely tie to the playing experience   like for example    but for most game I m usually do something else while the soundtrack play in the background so I struggle to pay attention to it   have this in mind   the soundtrack to be incredible    from the beautiful melody that play while you traverse young america on horseback   to the dramatic symphony that blast as you trek through rain and snow to put an end to your next foe really put you in the boot of a cowboy and rekindle your love for that slice of history   my favourite track be american venom   unshaken   and     this review be already quite long   but I m not lie when I say there be plenty more I could rant and rave about   unfortunately   a lot of it require you to play the game first and   well   that doesn t really work for this type of review   do it    if you haven t play this game yet   I just hope read this have prompt you to give it a go   I just hope you can experience this outstanding story    of the lust for greed   of the lust for power   and of corruption   but really   I just hope you ll be okay stand by and watch it happen

if I get to experience to play rdr    for the first time again   I would definitely take it    the game itself be enjoyable   immersive   and it provide a solid experience to the player   explore the world and not do the main quest be already enjoyable because the world be so immersive that you would forget do the main quest because it s fun to explore the world   it s fun to meet unexpected stranger because they re pack with interesting dialogue or unexpected side quest offer    on the other hand   I think the story be well write   despite that I get spoil on what would happen or who would die   it still surprise I when I experience it myself in the game

       thank you beelbub for introduce I to this masterpiece
nothing wrong with the game   the negative review be for rockstar for increase the base price of a    year old game by a whopping      just because they be release a     year old game from the same franchise on pc this month   scumbag corporate practice can go to hell   yes   yes   I know the publisher can price their game at whatever they want   well   I can give a review say whatever I want   freedom go both way    here s my original review which be initially positive            imagine the witcher     the cowboy version   pro      the world be simply beautiful   you could get lose in it for hour without get bore      story be a cinematic experience   can make you laugh   can make you cry      character development be top notch      voice act be so good that it bring the character to life      attention to detail be something that the game already get recognition for      different dialogue for every situation and action you take   npc line have be record for endless possibility of the player behavior      side quest be also beautiful   each chain of side quest be worth it    con      too long   too damn long   I have      hour on record   I can put in at least     more   I be never go to complete the compendium   kill x number of animal x number of time by horse trample yes it s an actual task    loot x number of store   travel from one town to another in an x amount of time etc etc   too many meaningless objective which have be add just to bloat the game time   completely unnecessary since the main game itself be long enough and very satisfying   game length be a completionist nightmare      when play with a controller   you need to tap a xbox   x ps   repeatedly to make your horse gallop   which be annoying af because the game be      horse ride   it s tiresome and irritate to continuously mash a button almost all the time you re in game      wish we have infinite stable space for horse   not really a con   just my wish    I could nitpick and give you a whole list of con but I forget they because the pro far outweigh the con and so it doesn t matter   the above two be the only main problem    advice to new player      find a good horse in chapter    and stick to it till the end of the game   do not change your horse afterwards even if you find a well one   it s worth it      design all your costume around arthur s default hat   the hat be special    these thing aren t a must but I find it to improve the story experience   think of they as soft recommendation   play as you want
nebunie cu cai
what the sigma
I see a man in valentine    I    you don t look tough   they     what do you say    I    you look dumb   they    I ve hear enough out of you     I shoot their dog    I recommend the game
film genre narrative amazing
one of the good single player narrative out there
great game ever make
u can shoot people head off
make I listen to the voice
this be a masterpiece   you have to try it out   work perfect on steam deck   if I cap the fps to      the fan doesn t even need to turn on    later edit   the multiplayer do not work anymore   the single player be still solid but the ask price be to much now in my opinion
I be a     yo father   probably one of the old people play this game   I be a single father to my son   who be     now   my son get this game for christmas in       from his uncle   so we instal it on his computer and he start play   by the end of the week he have     hour on this game   this be horrible for I   as it be already hard for I to find way to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch youtube   so I decide to make a steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game   pick my character and world and start play but I be stick on what you where suppose to do   I ask my son for help and he host a game for I to join   I love it as it be the good time I have spend with my son since my wife have die   this game have ever since bring I and my son close again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well   this game remind I that there s fun to be have in everything   and it have bring both I and my son many happy memory
play rdr   on my xbox year ago and decide to try it again on my monster pc   this game     to this day   be still an absolute masterpiece   still take my     spot for good game of all time   if you haven t play yet   give it a try   you win t regret it

masterpiece  
quite simply the good game I have ever play
wow   I love this game   and I love arthur morgan   I m only at chapter     but I m sure everything will end up alright   I wonder why he be not in rdr   though
its good
absolute cinema
 
hehe
   slow pace but good and smooth story     even in the single player s mode   it s still fun     feel all good sound effect of nature     enjoy the real relaxation while I m into the game     great job nice game     of     point
rdr   be a mostly great cinematic experience   but in a lot of way a mediocre gameplay experience on pc    there be a lot of time when the control don t make any sense   and it s unclear whether the game want I to hold a key down or tap it repeatedly   there be far too many weird qte minigame during cinematic sequence   with all sort of different variant of a bad control scheme   the game can t decide if it want I to watch a cutscene or play it    a lot of the mission be too strictly scripted   and will instantly fail if you try to improvise or do anything other than exactly what the mission text be tell you to do    repetitive craft action take far too long and can t be queue up   so you re stick watch the same boring animation over and over and have to press a single button to perform the action again at regular interval   people claim that it s for immersion purpose   but for I it have the opposite effect    the character s movement can feel sluggish   and the cover system be frustrating and clunky   some action   like target npc to talk to they   require the same right mouse button click as aim your gun   which lead to some really annoying situation where you re try to do one thing and end up do the other    the whole   core   system for health   stamina and deadeye be pointlessly convolute   and should ve be scrap   there be no real depth to it   but it make the hud for those attribute difficult to read at a glance   and you find yourself accidentally use the whole bar and dip into your core simply because of bad ui and system design    in typical rockstar fashion   the majority of the character be simply irredeemable jerk and act like selfish psychopath with no real motivation other than greed or malice   this lessen the emotional impact of the story for I   since I can t bring myself to care about these character    it suffer from multiple annoying technical issue on the pc version   unfixable audio crackling and popping be the big one for I     don t get I wrong   there s a lot of good gameplay in here as well   and a beautiful open world to explore   but the game get in its own way a lot   and that detract a lot from the experience for I    I get this on a deep sale   and while I don t regret my purchase   I m very glad I didn t buy it at full retail price   I can t recommend the game for all the reason list above   but if none of those reason would bother you   then you might enjoy it more than I do

I come to this conclusion after my first play through on ps   in       and it have not change one bit   arthur morgan might be the great protagonist in fiction and this be the great game ever make   perfect story   perfect game play   perfect everything
this be   by far   the good game ever make   I can not imagine anything else than a rockstar game beat this masterpiece   as no game on this planet have yet come close   only   criticism    no game for rusher   if you can t just let go of the sprint key and enjoy the incredible immersive world this game offer it may not be a game for you
I m play this game third time and still love it
absolute masterpiece       lennyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy of   
genuinely the good game I have ever play   this beautiful game capture the ending of the wild west perfectly and teach multiple lesson along the way   depend on how you play   if you have bad honor the game be about a man who can t change while if you have good honor   it s about do what s right even with the world against you   I have play this game over    time through   two of which include a mod where I only have    health the entire time   I have over       hour on my ps   and however many hour my review say on my pc   if you haven t play through this game   you definitely should   it ll make you laugh and it ll make you cry and be definitely worth the experience
I love my horsey and my horsey love I

lennehhehhehh
  may I stand unshaken    amidst the crash of world    the building of a shrine    only just to burn    you want a game that be a true labor of love   down to the tiny of detail and rich of identity    story   character   and open world    you re look right at it   you want a truly immersive and incredible standout from an   oversaturate market    this be it   especially if you re look for a beautiful   relatable   and historically accurate landmark western tale of loyalty   rivalry   inequality   and redemption
yee haw   
I can finally be a cowboy

thank you rockstar
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
the rockstar game launcher be pure trash and keep delete my save     h of gameplay wipe for no reason other than clueless moron want their own save system instead of use steam s   game be great but it be well enjoy without some incompetent douche delete your progress
red dead redemption    be a game that transport player into a rich   immersive world set in the late      s   it masterfully capture the essence of the wild west   offer player a sprawl environment full of life   atmosphere   and memorable experience    positive    one of the most outstanding aspect of red dead redemption    be its storyline   which become particularly compelling from the middle of the game onwards   the character arc deepen   and the narrative reach emotional height that be hard to find in other open world game   the game s story take you on a journey fill with moral dilemma   betrayal   and personal growth   and by the end   it s impossible not to feel connected to arthur morgan and the rest of the gang    equally impressive be the western world the game create   from dusty town to vast plain   snowy mountain   and dense forest   the level of detail in the environment be breathtake   the sense of scale and realism make every ride on horseback or trek through the wilderness an adventure in itself   the world feel alive   with random event   wildlife interaction   and encounter with npc make it a living   breathe ecosystem    the environment be not just a backdrop   it play an integral role in how you experience the game   the dynamic weather   day night cycle   and diverse ecosystem add layer of realism and immersion that few game can match    negative    however   like any large scale game   red dead redemption    be not without its flaw   bug occasionally disrupt the otherwise seamless experience   some of the most notable issue include odd glitch like the boat act strangely in water   and npc clothing   such as woman s skirt   sometimes react in unnatural way   in certain area   the horse ai can also behave erratically   with the horse suddenly veer toward object or obstacle seemingly without reason    these technical issue   while frustrating   don t take away from the overall experience   they can occasionally break immersion   but they be not game breaking   and most player will still be deeply engross in the world    conclusion    overall   red dead redemption    deliver a remarkable experience that be hard to match in term of its story   world building   and environmental depth   despite some technical hiccup   the game s positive far outweigh its downside   make it a must play for anyone who appreciate a rich narrative and a world that feel genuinely alive
it be a masterpiece that set the bar for open world game   with breathtaking visual   a deeply immersive story   and lifelike character   it deliver an unmatched experience   after play this   no other aaa game will feel as satisfying or immersive   it s truly a game you ll never forget

peak story
last game I buy from rockstar game   impossible to launch it because steam account already link to an old rockstar account I don t have access anymore   impossible to relink to a new one   so impossible to play any rockstar game in the future    refund  
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   unable to play the game as rockstar be incapable of unlinke an old account to which the email be delete year ago   so now I will never be able to play rockstar game from my steam account    what a joke
should deserve a goty winner   
the good   
bad customer support ever
well most relaxing game I ve ever play
be cowboy yeah I shoot everyonbe in the town they get mad charge I      dolar    online still do not work good
definitely the good game in the world    we shoot those who need to be shoot   save those who need to be save   and feed those who need to be feed
I love my horsey and my horsey love I
rockstar games launcher be garbage   just waste     minute try to log in to play a game I buy year ago   never give this company another dime   easy to find a version on the open sea without corporate drm and spyware
yes   it s safe to say this game be a massive failure   it s messy   ugly   offensive   unpolished and barely functional a lot of the time   so why do I keep play it    there s just something about the duke   even at his bad   he inject far more personality into his game than any no name sgt   bland from generic military shooter         it s nothing even approach the awesomeness of duke nukem   d   but enough of the soul be still there for it to be an enjoyable distraction   maybe now it can even be view as so bad it s good    I cautiously recommend
it s about the getting away from it all    once play for six hour where all I do be fish   hunt   and play poker   and it feel like I really catch a few fish   hunt and eat fresh meat over an open fire   and lose a lot of money playing poker   a game be truly great when the most idle game play be as much fun as any part of the actual story    this game simply never get boring
its the reddest of dead  
I get a plan
          just play it until the end   by the way   thank arthur for the jorney
a bit slow in the beginning   but it speed up after a couple of chapter so take yor time to explore   hunt and meet stranger   story be         almost cry several time   strongly recommend
arthur be the most sigma male you ll ever meet
it s a cowboy game where you shoot thing and hunt and lumbago    side note   don t bother with the online mode
   I didn t receive this product for free
I love my horsey and my horsey love I   
ten out of ten game   absolute cinema
the good game ever exist   yet

cowboi and gun      
I do not understand how journalist and other can rate this         for what    the outdated and dysfunctional gameplay   hilarious mission design or an atrocious interface    its         despite a reasonable story and good visual   audio   because of the incredibly bad gameplay   how be this even a game    its more like a slide show where you can add your own mouse click here and there but it do not make a difference       overall its mostly a micro management base horse riding and cart drive simulator from an insanely overrate company       in short this be a bad product on a technical level of       with modern graphic   its a waste of money and clearly not recommend to buy    detail                                  launcher terror   connect you to rockstar game service        first you need to go through a lengthy registration process with the rockstar launcher which be just a buggy loading gate   starting take age on a machine that be far beyond the max requirement   on every start you be force to watch the entire intro that roll down all the extra legal disclaimer   advertising for their new game and other useless trash   not acceptable rockstar   be that how you respect your customer    then well go home and sell sausage    graphic and detail secondly       the landscape   the story   the audio      the detail be all amazing   the graphic be absolutely on par with other more modern game even though they be less flashy   how must the environmental designer be unhappy that their effort be ruin by their incompetent gameplay counterpart who can not even offer a functional save and load mechanism    gameplay the gameplay be plain horrible and a mere show of incompetence   the ui be cluttered and unwieldy   they put ton of effort into shape small detail   add chore around your horse etc    I love that    often where nobody would even see it but completely fail to provide even halfway decent basic movement and inventory control   control a figure in the original half life be well than this   poor arthur be do his good but move like a cupboard      he can not even really jump      move around be a real challenge and super unnerve    I have rarely see such a clunky and unnecessary complex system   generally micromanage everything but lack finesse on the other hand be the thing here   object be sometimes interactive sometimes not   sometimes its r to pick something up   sometimes tab   press a to draw your revolver   press h to lift it   press u to aim   press f   to pull the trigger finger   press p   y   lm   simultaneously to release      how be that suppose to make fun    no      gunfight be simply a       game style nightmare    this be particularly bad if you be in a combat situation where aim and shooting be a nightmare because the cross hair move with paralyse speed even if the sensitivity be maxe   draw a weapon force you to equip it from the wheel first      in all honesty      if you die without your horse be near you respawn without anything   not even your revolver because its tie to your saddlebag   you get even kill in fistfight     I mean who design such nonsense and believe that this be a quality game    but hey let make it bad        immersion be at zero      the game constantly tell you what to do and how      all of the interaction be so convoluted that you find yourself in an endless giant hand hold tutorial where new button prompt and hint be clutter the screen constantly and rip you out of the story   honestly however most of the time you be listen to lengthy cut scene anyway and not much be happen   on the other hand they do not manage to provide a reasonable map and travel option   distance be extreme so most of the time in the game you spend go from one place to another   a real fast travel system be not available   if your mission be to bring someone to another place on your horse you can be sure that this require you to spend several minute real time   I suggest that you spend      in the game with drive   riding or watch cut scene while the game force you to go as slow as possible   the occasional event can not hide that the world be mostly empty   due to the clunky control you have no desire to explore    already the first mission be a grind and what would be a small thing fluently execute in game like tsushima be a nightmare here   this claim to be open world but be only another game that force you in the most unintelligent way where ever you would need choice   once you start a   mission   you can not do anything else   at any time in a   mission   step one foot out of the indicate line      you get mission fail after    second and you need to start over   there be no intelligent option and the outcome be always script anyway   so basically you only have the honour to do some mouse clicking to continue with the game monologue   money be mostly worthless because many item in shop be either not available to you or do not make any difference   especially most well weapon be lock in the catalogue   you only get they from mission   the reputation system be just break   criminal behaviour can be report even without anyone in the vicinity see it   even if you obscure your face you be almost always recognise anyway so that you can be force to spend your hard earn money on bounty   so you do rarely want to shoot first but often enough you die then   take thing from a random corpse already dead magically reduce your karma like in a fantasy game   it all do not make any sense   brave new open world       in all earnesty you loose      of the little money you have as a penalty if you die and then get spawn randomly   why not link this to your paypal account and extract real money for die    that would fit the the greedy rookstar mindset of our day   the broken save point system be another big minus   it do not make sense to save anything   even if you save in a mission it just start at the entry point of the mission easily loose you     min of gameplay   autosave overwrite your current save   they even warn you that the game take the liberty to prevent you from build a backup save but just make some destructive random save   this be all insanely dysfunctional   those be design decision make by people light year away from reality   they just care for their own vision not their customer   if you be unable to port game from your lousy console   then do not bother your customer with your incompetence rookstar    let face it rockstar get famous because they have the gal to use laughably aggressive language and theme in their klutzy product   not because those be good game or they be in any way competent      look at rdr online and you know how bad they be
red dead redemption    online be a complete disaster   this game be an embarrassment to rockstar s legacy   the entire online mode be break beyond belief   and rockstar have clearly abandon it   hacker run rampant   and the company do absolutely nothing to stop they   no animal spawn   npc disappear   and entire section of the map feel like ghost town   mission fail to trigger   player get stick in endless loading screen   and persistent bug like   moonshine shack not load   or   camp disappear   have be ignore for age    from what I ve see   the hacker be actually celebrate their destruction of the game   openly mock the community because rockstar have give up on police their own server   player be constantly getting griefe   pull into modder trap   or blow to bit with god mode hacker   and the company do nothing    meanwhile   rockstar continue to pretend everything be fine   post as if the game isn t on life support   probably hope no one notice while they shift all their focus to gta     they don t even bother with basic update anymore   we re leave with broken daily challenge   invisible horse   and multiplayer event that crash your game    if this be the care and attention rockstar be give rdr   online   why would anyone trust they with gta     they ve essentially throw this game to the wolf   if they let this happen here   what s to stop the same chaos from happen in gta     the writing s on the wall if rockstar can t control their game now   why would anyone believe they ll get it right later    if I hold stock in this company   I d sell it immediately   at this rate   gta    could end up flop just as hard as star war rebel   rockstar need to own up to this mess and fix their game   or they ll lose whatever goodwill they have leave   it s embarrass   unprofessional   and utterly disgraceful for a company that be once know for push the boundary of what game could be
can no long play thank to social club   refund be not work for this product either   may external game launcher be the death of we all
after an update to the game it be unplayable no matter what you try and rockstar support do not care   nothing on youtub work    I be able to play it about    month ago and now nothing   I have it on ea and have same issue as with steam   untill rockstar come up with a fix this   do not get reddead   not worth it  
the game require rockstar launcher to run and rockstar refuse to make retrieve lose password acheivable force to buy the game again   instead of spend time make a new game to play they sit on their haunch of old game for     year and force you to rebuy over and over again
my rockstar account get hack and their support team be not willing to help I at all   I give they all the detail from steam and the bill of purchase    avoid this scammer company
abandon and forget online mode   lack content
I love this more than gta
good game in the world
play this game for the single player    don t bother with multiplayer as with any other rockstar game   it s just full of modder that will grief you with no legitimate way to report they
simply put the good game I have ever play period   just experience it once in your lifetime a modern masterpiece
game be lock to a launcher   which get tie to your steam account   somehow my steam account be not tie to the launcher account with red dead and I can not play my game   support be ai chat bot that will not actually help you   and even when they   escalate   the issue   you just never get a response   so yeah   I can not recommend a game I literally can not play anymore
well the game be revolutionary   everything be almost perfect   but what be so annoying and spoil the game be the save load mechanic   after load   you be not sure at which point in timeline be you   there be no way to name the save so you can know   the only way be to rely to the timestamp
overrate   ride out to mission get very boring   the same old gun play get boring   kill the     th lawman to spawn into a town with the population of     get boring   the story center around deep loyalty to a man with one brain cell who have you clean horse barn to foster relationship that might get your gang ahead like some child write his mob movie set in the world of cowboy   which get boring
really enjoyable game   however   I do get frustrate with the force tutorial game play at the beginning   certain thing be unavoidable due to the tutorial style progression at the beginning which result in bounty   money spend   etc   great game   wish there be a coop or multiplayer option for story mode or more mission through the online to play with friend
I buy a steam deck for play everywhere and this piece of shut don t let I play if I don t have internet   come on rockstar     that suck   
yes
take as much time as you can   really absorb this world   you win t regret it

red dead redemption    be an engrossing western that reel you in with its complex   rich open world after an initial adjustment to an intentionally reduce gameplay pace   I find that it ultimately reward your attention through the exploration of arthur s relationship with the van der linde gang   a very powerfully move game and message

good western game out drrr
this be my favorite game of all time   I think a lot of people get the wrong idea of it due to the community s focus on meme and the gameplay aspect   but the story be one of my favorite   there s so much nuance and detail to it that I could rant about for hour upon hour   the narrative be just construct and tell so well   the game itself be so detailed   I could spend hour just collect plant   hunting   and explore   my friend and family be honestly tired of how much I talk about this game
more addictive than cocaine gum
one of the good game I ve ever play   still graphically beautiful year after its release
will not play off line   social club error
it s red dead redemption     arguably the good game rock star have ever make    it s like the first red dead redemption   except more be in it and pretty    buy it   you goof
can t get through one mission without the game crash   nearly    hour of watch video try to fix setting   delete certain file   etc   the one thing I miss about console game   rarely any crashing or issue

a game that be run by hacker that rockstar let happen   but still sell it as their game   not sure why this be even for sale even   steam knowingly sell a game run by hacker   be a great game   but be now complete trash   if you play online   you be make your computer vulnerable to these hacker
great game of this century be not only a word   I will work hard and save my money to buy a well pc and a proper place to play it on ultra
what a game
  I give you all I have    from the moment arthur morgan step onto the sun drench plain of the late    th century american frontier   red dead redemption    be more than just a game   it s a journey into a world that feel as alive and untamed as the wild land it portray   having spend     hour immerse in this masterpiece   I can confidently say that the experience be as unforgettable as the tale of the old west itself    rockstar game have create a vast epic that   at its heart   tell the deeply human story of arthur morgan a character whose depth and development set new standard for protagonist in video game   arthur be not merely a rugged outlaw   he be a man struggle with his past   the burden of his decision   and the disintegrate world around he   his story unfold with an authenticity that be both move and inspire   leave a lasting mark on anyone who engage with it    what truly set red dead redemption    apart be its commitment to realism and immersion   from the rustle leave in a dense forest to the distant sound of a train whistle   every sound and sight add to a captivating sense of place   the game s attention to detail be apparent in every corner of its expansive world   make it a marvel of interactive storytelling    additionally   the soundtrack of red dead redemption    be nothing short of exceptional   the musical score   include the hauntingly beautiful   unshaken    perfectly complement the game s atmosphere and narrative   it deepen the emotional impact of key moment and enhance the overall experience   leave player with a lasting impression long after the game be over    in conclusion   red dead redemption    be a triumph of storytelling and design   it challenge the boundary of the medium   offer an experience that be both grand in scale and intimate in its portrayal of the human condition   for those seek an adventure that be as deep as it be breathtake   this game be a must play    pro   deep character development   especially for arthur morgan stunning and immersive world rich storytelle varied and dynamic gameplay experience exceptional soundtrack   include the standout track   unshaken    rating

cow boy pew pew
I play     hour on the game and now I get a warning that I be not entitle to play the game   what the actual                
red dead online have so many bug the game be basically unplayable   you have a bug where your horse main transportation   will not come   you have on one where you get stick in stable and have to force quit   with the trader roll when try to resupply after you talk to cripps you stand there look stupid because after the cut scene the quest do not appear   bounty hunt mission also take forever to start up   and harriet also do not spawn   this game be just full of bug that have you server hop more than you re play the game   honestly right now even with the constant discount its a waste of money
a masterclass in time theft    the game go out of its way in every possible gameplay mmechanic   cutscene and storyline to waste your time   I hear argument that     second loot animation for every single cabinet opening be aim to feel more immersive   for I this do the exact opposite and take I out of the experience   it take I out of be a player in control of the character   into watch a video of a man slowly open a cupboard    this same issue be repeat all across the game   from     minute horseride cutscene where you can not play   but also can not just put down the controller and enjoy the cutscene as a movie because you be force to keep tap x to move forward    the decision to lock sprinting to repeatedly tap x instead of a toggle or press tell I everything about how out of touch the ui and gaemplay design of rockstar be and I find it unacceptable and far below modern standard
  r n n iadesi ger ekle tirildi   game look fun but I never get to play it   rockstar lock I out of my account because of an email verification issue that do not make any sense   the rockstar customer service be the bad I ve ever encounter   I be ask to send in identical information multiple time from duplicate script response to my ticket   this correspondence go on for four day with no solution or even proposal    when I call this out they close my ticket and mark it as resolve   any additional ticket be not respond too and also mark as resolve   a massive        you   in my opinion   if you buy a game from they and you encounter any kind of technical issue you be likely on your own   I have this issue with gta v as well   its a shame and a pathetic waste on rockstar part
red dead redemption    be one of the most overrated   frustrating   and downright infuriate gaming experience I ve ever have the misfortune of endure   from the moment you start   the game throw you into a slog of mind numbingly slow and pointless cutscene that feel like they re try to be a bad western movie rather than an actual game   the control be clunky   unresponsive   and feel like they be design by someone who s never play a video game in their life   ride a horse should be fun   but in rdr    it s a tedious chore that constantly have you run into random object   fly off cliff   or deal with the world s dumb ai traffic    the mission   don t even get I start   it s the same rinse and repeat formula   ride to point a   shoot some bad guy   watch another boring cutscene   rinse   and repeat   and don t even think about stray off the mission path   or else the game instantly fail you   open world   more like a lock down   heavily scripted theme park where every little bit of fun be crush under the weight of rockstar s obsession with   realism    you want to explore or do thing your way   tough luck   the game insist on hold your hand every step of the way like you re some kind of idiot who can t think for themselves    and let s not forget the character   arthur be cool   but the rest of the gang be a bunch of insufferable   whiny   and downright annoying clich s that you can t wait to be do with   the game try so hard to be deep and emotional   but it end up feel like a melodramatic soap opera that drag on for far too long    the bad part   the game just doesn t respect your time   long   unskippable animation for every little thing make even the simple task a chore   want to loot a body   get ready for the slow animation know to man   it s like rockstar go out of their way to make everything take ten time long than it should    red dead    isn t a masterpiece   it s a mess   a bloated   pretentious   self indulgent slog that mistake tedium for immersion and spectacle for substance   if you want to spend hour watch your character slowly saunter around do menial task while be hold hostage by the world s slow storytelling   then by all mean   knock yourself out   but for anyone with even a modicum of patience and a desire for actual gameplay   steer clear
jesus          christ the handholding in the beginning of this game be insane
what a special work of art rdr   be
l
perfection
fun xd
cowboy
I love my horsey and my horsey love I
each time I play the game it either crash   stutter every    second   or have input lag   not to mention the difficulty of even get the launcher to start up in the first place   I have experience all of these issue despite use a high end pc
this be one of those game I come back to frequently   it s a game that embrace the cinematic and the goofy like much of rockstar s lineup   but it stand out as more than an action exploration game and border on life sim in many way   definitely recommend as an experience to get lose in   take your time   there s a lot to see
arthur morgan doesn t read book   he stare they down until he get the information he want    time wait for no man   unless that man be arthur morgan     arthur morgan breathe air      five time a day    in the beginning there be nothing      then arthur morgan roundhouse kick nothing and tell it to get a job    if arthur morgan be to travel to an alternate dimension in which there be another arthur morgan and they both fight   they would both win    the dinosaur look at arthur morgan the wrong way once   you know what happen to they    arthur morgan   tear cure cancer tuberculosis   too bad he have never cry    arthur morgan once roundhouse kick someone so hard that his foot break the speed of light   arthur morgan be the good
I get it yesturday end already play for     hour         its the good game ever
one of the good story line game I have every play   as someone who just get into gaming I would say this keep I very interested the whole time   I would highly recomend
one of few     out of     game s imo   after play the story for the second time around   I have to say arthur morgan may be the good video game protagonist ever make
not be able to play a singleplayer game without internet be fun   for the game itself   not be able to skip the intro prologue be also fun
   be bear to be a cowboy force to be a man in modern day
very good game
     
very fun and entertain
probably the good immersive game I have play
     
the good game I play
actually the good story game I ve ever play
it have horsie and doggo you can pat      
I would recommend to people but I wish it would add our own property so we could ranch and have our own house   I would like for they to add the action yard as well to buy and sell diffrent anmial

shoot the kkk be fun
   I have pretty okay spec but recently this game keep crash   I want to setup a camp suddenly game not respond
I love this game   I really do   I ve put      hour into it   problem be   three time now my save file have become corrupted right around the    hour mark   I d love to be able to finish it   but I ve lose all desire to do so after grind through the first couple of chapter    time   I really hope the devs will show some love and fix whatever it be that keep make this happen    some day in the future   I ll try again because I really want to beat this one
be it fun   yes   be it fun to have to sign legal agreement and setup rockstar account and have another password you have to remember and keep safe in case of a data breach so everything else you own isn t compromise before you even get to the main menu   nope   not at all
