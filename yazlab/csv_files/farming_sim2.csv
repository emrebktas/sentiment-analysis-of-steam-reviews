I ve be play this series since       and as far as I m concerned this be not only the good one yet   it s the one that s add the most useful feature in one iteration   for one   and I didn t see this mention in any of the professional review I read   the ai have have a massive and much need overhaul   in all previous version of the game   the ai could only do field work   mean a single player run a large farm spend most of his time drive tractor to and fro   attach and detach implement   haul product and supply   etc   if you want to automate any of those other task   you need a mod call courseplay   and then you spend more time          with menu and recording route in courseplay than you do farming   which greatly reduce the length of time it take for I to get bored and move on to other game    however   the vanilla ai be now capable of be order to drive from one place to another without have to pre record the route   they can even be tell to load product at one place   say   a silo   and deliver it to another   railroad or sell point   and repeat until do   the end result be you spend a lot more time do your fieldwork of choice and a lot less time drive across the map    another area of vast improvement be the addition of season   this have have a couple major impact on gameplay   all positive as far as I m concern   in the old season less version   it make sense to plant the next crop right after you harvest the last one   which be unrealistic and immersion breaking   now you must follow the in game calendar and only plant and harvest specific crop during their designate season   this not only give a much more realistic workflow   it also have nice side benefit like see weed grow among the harvest stubble while wait for planting season   something you d never see in the old version where the planter follow right behind the combine    something unexpected that come with season be seasonal price change for every commodity   this appear to have replace the old   great demand   and random price fluctuation of the old version   in the old game   you have to learn by experience what a good price for each commodity be and sell when it be high than usual   or you could wait for a   great demand   and sell for a guarantee good price for whatever commodity be in demand at that time   which be usually what I do   to get the most bang for my buck   the problem with that system be that your   pay day   be completely random   it be common to go for long period of time without a great demand for anything that you have   leave you with the choice between wait more and accept a low price   the game now have predictable seasonal change for every good   meaning you get pay every december   or every january   or whatever month happen to be prime month for what you re grow and manufacture    speak of manufacturing   that s another big feature of      production chain   for every crop that can be grow   except maybe potato    there be a corresponding production facility that will process it and turn it into something more valuable   grain get turn to flour   sunflower   canola and olive get process into oil   grape get process into raisin   which get add to sugar and corn to make cereal   the list go on   it s a neat way of increase your payday without have to farm more ground   and it s just plain cool to see your trailer load up with pallet of various good   head to the supermarket    yet another new feature   at least I believe it s new   be the way vehicle maintenance be handle   you ve always have to repair your vehicle over time   but I believe this be the first version that increase maintenance cost as vehicle age   which be not only realistic   it also add a new layer of decision make to the game   do I keep pump money into this old beater or bite the bullet and just replace it already   since I only need a combine once a year   would it actually be cheap to lease it and return it immediately rather than keep it for decade and deal with the ever increase repair bill   it s a small change that have a big impact than at first glance   and be all the more welcome for it    all in all   this be a fantastic game and definitely the most   mature   of the series so far   I d recommend it to new player and old fan alike   with a slight warning to newbie that there be a lot to learn   but that s part of the fun   right
update             summary at bottom   not a reskinned f     I have about      hour on fs    and I can most certainly say this be much well in many way   and many thing have be completely overhaul      sound have have a major overhaul   make the game feel more realistic and immersive     a few minor realism addition   like visual gear shift   cab suspension   etc     more placeable than ever   include shed with working door   refuel station   seed    fert tank   etc   fence   light   and other decor too   to brighten up your farm a bit     many new brand   and more tire brand option   also license plate for equipment and vehicle     character customization   imo   not the good   graphic and general proportion look weird   but hey   well than before     well organize xml file   much more easy on the eye compare to fs     and easy to find thing such as the money value   I don t need to use ctrl f anymore   I can just scroll    speaking of xml editing   instead of edit the careersavegame xml file like fs      f    to edit your cash   here you need to edit farm xml file instead in the same folder   careersavegame xml be only for appearance in the main menu      well organize shop ui   not to mention the ui overall   imo   the weird blue fade on the speedometer tachometer remind I of those old game   and I wish they have just instead update the fs    one     an actual american base map   major improvement from ravenport and goldcr valley   feel more of the true american countryside thank to that new office here in the u s   that giant get a while ago     buying use equipment   great for start a farm on a tight budget   and in multiplayer you can buy other farm s sell vehicle   wish there be more than    at a time though     vehicle gearbox   not require if you don t want to use it   but I like it   a wee bit confusing at time however   I m use to the way you shift in american truck simulator   but this be different   not bad   maybe need to be tweak a bit   will note that it s sometimes buggy   especially with mod     obviously graphic   you win t really notice a huge jump between fs    and f    as the major jump of the franchise be between f    and fs     but there be some noticeable change   also    d track on tractor   no more jpeg track     season   I don t like play so realistic to the point I have to wait time for the proper planting and harvesting time   but there s an option to make it so the season be just visual only     multiplayer voice chat   very useful    now   there be of course many bug with the game   and some feature miss since it get release not too long ago    some rather aggravate bug miss feature be     landscape   a tad bit annoying with the camera and movement   there s no snap thing to a certain rotation   and the camera angle be from a bird s eye view that swoop down instead of zoom in   which be rather annoying when try to line thing up together   there s also no sprinting like in fs     idk about the other     ai worker   we all know from previous fs game that the ai be notorious   especially in f     here   there have be some improvement   and with the addition of ai be able to drive vehicle to and fro   that s really useful   but again   very buggy   the classic   helper f be block by an object    pop up every now and then   you tab over and there s nothing in it s way   lately   on modde map   the ai sometimes will just sit there do nothing   possibly just a mod side issue     building   most notably the farmhouse   if you look into the window   it s just a copied   jpeg of a weird look kitchen with yellow cabinet and a granite look wall   I m sure giant will add in an interior at some point   I don t want jpeg interior like fs      fs     also   you can not interact with enter any exist building shed barn on the farm on the land you purchase   I sure hope that get change   note   kinda sorta fix   some shed you can enter    bug tl dr     landscape   control    view angle be awkward     ai drive transport   block by nothing   drive the wrong path or drive in circle      didn t note this but general physics   collision   and the gearbox still need to be tune    tl dr    there be many bug   I hope they ll be fix before the next year   but there be also many improvement from previous fs game   as someone who s play fs     xbox            steam    and      epic game     at this time   with the amount of bug miss feature in the game   you can go ahead and buy it if you want   I manage to snag a deal with the season pass where I get both for like       damn good deal   would not recommend pay full price for each individual dlc    I have not test everything   and I have not play every map   I do not have all of the bug and missing feature list   I will update this review as I come across more notable bug   miss feature   and change from previous fs game    again   this be a newly release game   so unless giant decide to not fix these issue keep they remove like ea do with battlefield        then I will change this review as need             update   so you can use q    e to switch between the license plate type   yet when you re type in your custom license plate and you need to press q or e   it switch the license plate type   they do have an on screen keyboard I assume for console   but I really don t want to   click   move mouse   repeat    more time    every single time I have to put in a license plate   my way to bypass this be make sure the color selection be highlight when you start type    the field care addon be nice   more stuff to do with grain farming   I haven t really play around with that yet    graphic for work the field look much well   but when the field state change   harvest to cultivate   to plow   etc   be still very noticeable and jittery   a bit annoying as it be ruin the immersion a little    pallet physics have improve a ton   however   but they do still slide around imo a wee bit too easily    bigbag   can easily pick they up with anything with fork   and you can feel that you re pick up a heavy item   they have realistic physics   so that s nice             update     pre place building can now be delete off of farm     the issue with the semi truck axle act weird be now fix   they drive much smooth now            update      character customization be save to the last customize option     license plate be also save the same way     update revised entire review          update    revise entire review again   clarify some thing   and remove some stuff that didn t need to be here to make room because of the damn review character limit             update    fine tune the review a little bit   move a few notable thing from previous update to the main category   blablabla   I don t think I can do much more for this review   especially with the character limit
I buy fs    when I see it on sale when it be about a year old with the expectation of play it with a friend for    hour and get bore   we literally purchase it as a goof   I end up put over      hour into f     and buy fs    the moment it come out   I currently have       hour in fs     so of course I have to one up and buy fs       I just break   k hour in fs     do not play this game   it look boring   it look lame   you will lose your soul   it will ruin relationship and friendship   your grade will suffer   you will use your pto and sick day at work   if you think you re strong enough and buy it anyway   for the love of god do not start download mod       lord help I   I m open the game again
I have play the farming simulator series since fs    and have log many hour into the series   I can tell you a few thing      this be not just a reskin of fs     many thing have change and honestly this be the good in the series to date       yes there be a few bug   but nothing game break      this installment have the good material handling   just tonight I load a semi trailer full of strawberry pallet by hand with no issue at all   bale have also improve a lot       there be a lot more in this installment then we ever have have before which will help with keep you busy on the farm   cow   chicken   pig   and sheep be the only animal   but with the addition of production building it keep you busy and want to work hard to own they       start map be great   unlike fs     the american map feel good   I just wish we have some sort of animal pen to start with and a big yard   but again I be enjoy it   work hard to grow my farm land so I can get into cow as I be a dairy farmer grow up   but the map be not bad    if you be a fan for giant and farming simulator pick this title up and have fun   this be the first in the series they put out themselves and be the most optimize in the series to date   it will only go up from here       I see this question a lot and you might see the bad review about the season pass   be it worth get   my answer be this    yes as in the long run ti will save you some cash   yes there be    dlc s that be out now that be not include in the season pass   a small tractor you will never use   a black beauty and a mack truck skin    the reason these be not include be because these be all some sort of pre order bonus    the season pass will cover the dlc s for the first year but not the pre order bonus   you will understand that if you read the description of the pass       american equipment be pretty lacking   but this be what be great about this series   if you play any other you know the mod community be great and you will see plenty out soon   this again be not   game breaking   because like any farmer you need to make due with what you have       crossplay be a thing now   yes pc player can now play with xbox and ps player   you be limit to the mod that mod maker and giant allow to be place in the mod hub   but this be a start   I love it because I can now play with my farming buddy that only have an xbox while I be on my pc    I hope this review help someone that be not a fan boy but have put in a lot of hour in this series   at first I be not go to get fs    after not have a lot of fun in f     but I be sure glad I buy it   because like I say   this be the good I have ever see it

why be productive irl when you can virtually farm      
the plot   you be a shapeshifting chronomancer who have decide to take up farming in a mundane world   you have the ability to speed up and slow down the progression of time at will   you can use spell like save and load to create a fix point in time that you can travel back to later if you change your mind about something   the season pass like day for you    you can also inexplicably teleport around between various building and vehicle you can ride in as well as teleport vehicle and tool back to the shop you buy they from   thank to your ability to bend time   store be always open for you   though there be some strange aspect of this world that you don t quite understand yourself   car have an infinite amount of mass and no matter how heavy your vehicle be   they can brush you aside effortlessly   though they be courteous enough to stop and communicate by blow their horn at whatever be in their way   people and animal be seem to phase through your vehicle   but the people on foot never seem to notice you    with your time warp power and your ability to control various diesel power machine   as well as a few electric one   you set about to build yourself a life as a simple farmer while do battle with the force of the bank who be more than willing to lend you money   but take their interest relentlessly   thin profit margin   and a somewhat unstable economy
farming simulator     be an immersive agricultural experience   for player who re willing to spend hour try to make the most of their farm   it offer a lot   you can choose to focus on your crop   animal husbandry   or forestry   fan of the series will be grateful for the official implementation of season   and the production chain mean there re even more way to make money and grow your empire   it doesn t cater for new player in the same way   but there s still a hook for amateur to get go   with some lovely visual and a faithful simulation of real life farm   you re not go to find a well game out there
you do farm   but in     
this satiate my manly urge to leave this sick society behind and start a farm

you know   I ve hit      hour on this game in the last nearly    year   and I figure it s time for a review   so let s get into it    there be alot of people dog on this game for just be another repeat    which it be   I have to agree with this   but also remember the fact there s a ton of new feature and polish with this   this game feel like a whole different franchise just from the polishing   there isn t random clipping texture   hole in equipment      p look wear texture on equipment    this game look good   like really good   though if I m honest this game be what     need to be    big feature with this version be the addition of build in season which you can customize to your liking   and while it may not be realismus season   it s pretty damn good   I really enjoy play with it   also the map have ton of live feature now   so for example when a new dlc be approach the billboard and sign start show info for that dlc   and during season   you ll see barbecue in the summer   halloween deco in october   and snowman christmas deco in december   it s a really nice addition   and finally the map feel like they have some life   as for the map themselves   you have elmcreek which be base in the midw region of the usa   hard to place exactly where but I would say iowa indiana illinois area   just base on the overall area   there be also a french map   that I think be pretty bland and disappointing   and I couldn t say where it s base but I would say it s the western part   there be also erlengrat which be a swiss map from fs    s alpine dlc   it s the exact same map and while I love play on it   it do have some fps issue and can be very confusing if you don t understand the concept of the map    next we move onto equipment   here s where it get wild   the brand they bring into this release   among small thing everybody have want   be insane   there have to be a minimum of     new brand in this game and at least      new machine not count any dlc   it s truly insane the equipment selection in this game   there s some weak point   like mid size seeder and cultivator   but there s way around it   you of course have plenty of mod   or you can stick with small stuff and just deal with the extra time take   I do a mix of both   there s some tractor that have we and eu spec option   all crawler tractor and harvester have   d track   interior be fully animate    there s an insane jump in this version that     doesn t have   yes     have some stupid nice tractor but not all   you could see the recycled stuff compare to the new stuff   in this version even the recycled equipment have all the up to date feature   it s truly another level of attention to detail   not to mention loader and such now make a bang when lower fully   new hydraulic sound   new attach sound    and don t forget manual transmission   while the implementation of manual be pretty garbage   it s still one more thing this game be severely lack in old version   it s only weird on some vehicle   on some it work fine   all in all have this feature in the base game be a huge jump even if it s implement terribly    in term of the farming aspect   it s pretty much the same   however there be some small difference   with season enable   you can only plant and harvest in certain month of the year   which add just a little more realism   crop growth be no long randomize   it take a set amount of month to grow whether you have season on or off   for example wheat take     month   and potato take     the plant harvest chart reflect this   turn off the season just make it where you plant whenever and harvest whenever   there be also parallox occlusion mapping   which make anything row look   d even though they aren t   while it may not be as good as true   d ground   it look extremely nice   there be also grape vine and olive grove now   and the respective equipment to harvest these   they be annoying   but fun   there be no new animal in this version   aside from these it s pretty much the same old farming system from       now on to landscaping and build mode   the landscaping mode remain mostly unchanged from fs    aside from be way more polished and work a whole lot well   among new ground material   foliage and ground be separate   and you can do some truly wild stuff through the landscaping tool   as for build mode   this be a new addition that effectively take the placeable menu and turn it into it s own mode   there s a ton of new list and menu   you can place almost anything   fence   animal pen   decoration   production    almost anything you can place   and if you don t find it there   guarantee there s a mod for it   you can literally build a map from bare nothing if you want use just the build and terrain tool   it s pretty cool    come to the end you have stuff such as the modhub   crossplay support   multiplayer   and other finishing touch   the multiplayer be an absolute disaster   I m not talk in people   I m talk the server side   it s be pretty broken since the game s release   and only minimal improvement over time   they consolidate the    individual server down to    massive server   and on busy day   forget mp entirely   it overload in no time flat   and if you do get in   have fun stay in   it s a disaster   as for the in game modhub   not much be change   though you no long have to restart after get mod   they just automatically install and you re all set   there s a good selection of mod   both pc only and crossplay   and that bring we to crossplay   you can play with someone on a console   from pc   as long as you have match crossplay mod   not just any mod be crossplay   only certain one be   because console be so limited on space and licensing   only non license   and brand already in game   be allow   this will never be change   if you want a bunch of cool modde stuff   buy a pc and do the game the right way   console be not mean for this type of game    all in all   this game be a        there be a ton of good feature about it   it s extremely stable and seem to just work all time unlike the last    version   and there be a few bad feature   the big thing to I be I feel like a lot of the feature of this should have be for f    and in this version they should ve focus on   d ground   more realistic harvesting   more crop and other thing people have be ask about for year   but maybe the next iteration will have a few of these   though this be a healthy addition   and while     be a ton of fun and I enjoy it   this be a much more polished game      be constantly crash   full of break equipment   miss texture   bug map and more   this one have hardly any bug   even when it release almost everything work   and within    week the game have no bug   the only real issue be the multiplayer   but it work if you understand when to use it for a good experience   all in all this game be a very polished and fun to play game   the price tag be a little high   but it be worth it   the attention to detail in this version be worth the extra money   you win t notice it until you play but they go over the top with detail on everything   it s pretty awesome    hope this be a helpful review that talk someone into this game   I know I ve         my money worth and will continue to do so   this be a really good game in the series   let s hope the next one be even well

so   after three year for a company who s business plan seem to be to release a new game every two year I have high hope for this one   low expectation   but still   high hope    sadly   giant deliver as expect   in recognizable form they make sure to leave any real vision and improvement on the drawing board and release what feel more like a free update or a cheap dlc than a new game    new feature     season   more or less just copy paste a good mod from fs     instead of show we what a professional developer can do with a good idea   they just pay   I assume   the modder and call it do     production chain   as with season they take a mod s    streamline it a little and that s it   do     sound and gear system   this be in my opinion the only real improvement to the game   but it still need some polish and I would like a big variety in the engine sound       new crop   one be just another combinable crop and two orchard type crop   a bit of a gimmick   but I guess they tie into production chain so that s fine     new build mode   improve   but the terrain editor it s very basic and it s impossible to smooth it out to look close to real   even the developer can t do it right   check out the ground close to the cow pasture in erlengrat     new worker feature   worker can now be send from a to b   send to a field to do a job and cart   I only test this a few time and it work ok   but the path finding be far from perfect     ai traffic   ai car drive fast   I m sure that have to take a month or two to change   right   they be still on rail and it s still like hit a brick wall if you drive into they   there be no pathfinding   no avoidance   to call it ai be an insult to ai s everywhere     use equipment and separate maintenance and paint condition   a good idea   but again   very basic   also if you repair but don t repaint you vehicle the condition bar next to the speed o stay at about a quarter full might have be change fix      character creation   it s fine   but there be no slider for body shape or skin colour and just     predefine face     fieldstone   stone show up in field after plow and cultivate   sure   but I suspect most player s will turn it off after a short time so why bother   in my experience the worker have no idea what part of a field be do and not if you stop they half way through     change to the ui   sure   but be that the most important thing to improve    physics   the physics seem to have         little to no love     machine and equipment still have no real feeling of weight   no change in centre of mass when accelerate or brake   no rocking and roll on big rubber tire when you drive on uneven terrain or come a sudden stop   remember   even the small tractor in the game weigh      ton   more than twice the weight of a compact car     the physics of bale   pallet and log be still horrible   if you bump into they they slide around like on ice   they still glitch into pallet fork   bale spike and log claw and many other object   hit the   sweet spot   for pallet feel like a lottery   round bale be perfectly round and will roll away on the slight gradient instead of compress slightly under their own weight   and the log   the log can make even the most level head of we turn to violence     there might be a traction system hide somewhere deep inside the game   but it mostly seam to have little to no impact on gameplay   it s just cosmetic   where be the reason to choose wide or dual tire   why change away from narrow s after fertilize   why add wheel weight   add roll resistance might give we a reason to use communal tire to a vehicle mostly use for cart   especially if that be the only way to reach top speed    terrain     the terrain poly count can t have change much since the first game     how can a game release in       have road with sharp angle like you find around some bridge and   un loading station     otherwise the road be smooth as glass   with no bump   crack   pot hole or imperfection at all   most time you can not even tell if you drive from asphalt to grass     it would be nice to have a reason to want to stay on the road and dirt track when move from a to b but since the grassland and field be almost as smooth as the rest of the map most people just cut across    worker   the worker be as useless as ever   on a perfectly square field they do ok as long as there be no tree or building near by   on a slightly unevenly shape field they leave little miss bit most time they turn   they will come to a field edge   turn around and line up perfectly to continue before decide to go home   I create a field with a plow   seed two full lap of headland and set this dumbbell off on his own   he manage a few round and the proceed to seed     meter into the grassland next it before he quit   it can t possibly be that difficult to make the worker ai aware of what they be do   where they re suppose to do it and if they be finish do it   it s be like this since at least fs     there be no excuse     map and gameplay   other then the addition of production line   which be minor gameplay wise   there be no change   it s still farm   sell   repeat   the economy be as basic as ever   in the new price overview it look like it would be possible to predict when to sell   but from my experience this be either bugged or useless   there be three map with one start location on each   nothing new   nothing to be excited about   but they might be slightly big than in fs     it would be nice to have more option when you start a new game instead of start with the same machine   on the same farm   with the same budget every time you start a map   how about     different starting budget     a variety in start vehicle pack to choose from     a choice of several different farm on each map   vary in size and feel     rule set    I m the type of person who should love this game   but I don t   instead I get frustrated over bad mechanic   I m disappointed in the lack of creative thinking and development and angry that obvious bug and flaw stay in the game release   after release   I hope to some day play a good or even great farming simulator   but at this rate though   with statistically only        year leave to live   I don t like my odd    the farming simulator community be big for a work sim   and full of supportive player and modder who have be condition to lower their expectation for year   it s about time they be reward with a developer that at least aspire to get up to date with modern technology
I don t recommend this series   my kid be starve because I don t work   I don t work because I have such an important farm to care for   horse need ride   and the pig act like complete pig and constantly need food and water   I be always look for that dumb dog while be elbow deep in tractor grease   I be think about a forth mortgage so I can invest in the holstein market   my greenhouse be just barely make it and I be constantly at risk of have to toss my salad     good thing there be those cute sheep around   I be pretty sure my wife leave I because I never see she around the farm   so   I be pretty sure farming be my true calling       
ignore the negative review from people who have play for half an hour and say its the same as fs    because they be either troll be too stupid to take seriously      I be massively on the fence with purchase this game as fs    have year of mod and content to back it up   but I take a gamble and can honestly say I m glad I do   everything be improve in this game from fs     and I mean everything   the graphic be well   the sound be a massive improvement   vehicle handling be well   the ui from previous fs game have be throw out the window and completely redone and be dramatically well   the season be completely optional and can be configure however you please   the return of collectable   much more in depth character creator   the new ai system even in its first iteration be a dramatic overhaul and so much well than previous title   the build and terrain system be completely different and much well than previous game with a more rt feel to it like the new ai system   the new store layout be excellent with the ability to see and directly purchase all other item that be compatible with whatever you be buy and bulk buy pallet of seed etc   the new production chain be awesome and give you so much more to do than the standard fieldwork and sell of previous game   but for I by far the big and good improvement of this game be the plethora of new graphical option   optimisation and the addition of dlss support   I be play this game on maximum everything and my gpu be idle as I play the game instead of the jet engine it be play fs      all tell so far in over    hour of play I have experience zero bug   zero crash and nothing but amazement as to how far this game have improve since fs

my farming simulator     review   after       hour    as a gamer   I be initially skeptical about farming simulator      as it didn t seem like the type of game I typically enjoy   however   after give it a chance   I find myself pleasantly surprise by the game s depth and complexity    the game offer a vast open world environment to explore   with a wide variety of crop to cultivate and livestock to raise   the game s mechanic be complex and require careful planning and execution   which can be both challenging and rewarding    one of the highlight of farming simulator     be the game s new orchard system   which allow player to plant and grow fruit tree such as apple   cherry   and pear   the new crop   such as grape and olive   also add to the game s complexity   require specialized equipment and care    the game s dynamic weather system be another significant addition   with realistic weather affect the gameplay in many way   heavy rainfall can cause flooding   damage crop   while drought can reduce yield   require the player to use irrigation system to manage their water resource    the game s graphic and sound be impressive   create a highly immersive atmosphere   the texture and lighting be excellent   with realistic weather effect such as rain   snow   and fog add to the immersion   the game s music be relax and appropriate for the game s atmosphere    the game s multiplayer mode be an excellent way to engage with the community and share farming experience with friend   the game s modding support also offer great replay value and community engagement    overall   surprise I with its depth and complexity   and I would recommend it to gamer who enjoy simulation and management game   the game s new feature   include the orchard system and dynamic weather   add to the gameplay s challenge and reward   make it a must play for farming enthusiast
I have be a long time supporter of giant and the farming simulator franchise   have all previous release title on pc since     edition and most of the dlc throughout the year   not to mention get other to buy and play the game   and while I be annoy by how f    dlc be handle   when those of we that support the developer and purchase the game and some dlc along the way as they be release get no bundle rebate on steam   for part of bundle we already own    nothing come close to how giant be treat your customer with the platinum edition crap they be pull this time around    a new player get into the game now can get the fs    premium edition   get the base game and both season pass include platinum expansion for     euro   this be a good deal   I m not complain about this   it s a fair price for this late in the game lifecycle    but if I   with the base game   try to purchase premium edition on steam I get the follow message      so   accord to steam and how spesifically ask they to set the pricing    I want to get the full experience of fs     having already pay     euro for the base when it come out   now have to pay     euro for year    season pass and     euro for year    pass   an additional     euro   a total of       instead of      just because I dare to buy the base game when it come out    I get and agree on give a bundle price for new player late to the game   give a good value bundle price to entice they to the franchise   but you can do so without           over your exist player and tell they to go buy everything at full price just because they have the gall to purchase the game when it come out and wait for dlc to release    you price it as if you only have    type of customer   those that buy base game    season pass right as they come out   this be fine   they get content as it roll out   ignore the dlc outside of season pass issue    and those that buy into the game at the end of the game development   and only want to because a heavy discount    sure I could try and buy premium edition as a gift and claim it for myself   again get no value for my exist purchase of the base game   but have to circumvent steam store just to get the bundle price be ridiculous   not to mention most people don t know how steam handle gift bundle when you own an item in that bundle already   just have to gamble that it work    at a minimum give I the option to buy the same edition as new player have   direct in steam   there be no reason at all to lock that option from exist player    but preferably let exist own item be deduct from the bundle base cost   with the same bundle discount apply for remain item   like other developer be do    get your act together giant     I get that I m most likely scream into the void   but I for one be never go to buy a new fs game until the   final   premium bundle be out unless this change   if at all   and I will be directly recommend noone anyone else do either   both in friend circle and elsewhere
farming simulator     be the most recent entry into the series   and it definitely take the first step in while to move farming simulator out of the casual mode arcade experience and a close step towards simulation which the game title suggest it should be   this change however seem to have be receive by the community a lot like marmite   some love the direction the series be take   other seem really upset and offend by the change    we have for the first time a version of the popular season mod include in the base game   with crop planting and growth calendar to follow which dictate at what time of the year you can seed and plant your crop   this have be a much request feature for farm sim since back in f    when season mod first release   so it s also somewhat strange reading review and read forum post how this much request feature   now include in the game be not see by some people as a bad feature and backward step in the game because it make the game more realistic and make you have to think about what you be do   some player seem upset that they can no long seed a crop at   be in the morning and harvest it at   pm that same evening   player want realism and then complain when the game take a step in that direction   I don t understand that    the season mode can be disable however by player if they don t want to deal with that or don t have the attention span require to play a simulation game in that way   the season growth calendar can be disabled to allow player to plant and harvest at whatever time of year   they can also shorten the in game month to last just one in game day   so can fly through a whole year in the game in just     in game day   which they could also speed through at x     normal speed if they really want   so again the negative review and comment from player who say it take too long for crop to grow and too long to get stuff do really baffle I again   clearly these people just need to play around with their ingame setting to strike the balance that work for they    in farm sim     this year because of the season mode and even with it disable the increase to crop growth time   giant have implement and include several new fieldwork task like mulch   roll   stone collecting as well as change and revamp the weed system to include more growth stage and long period where mechanical weeder and hoe can be use to remove the pesky weed   whilst also implement a new penalty system for use herbicide to remove weed at more advanced stage of growth which can impact your yield   this provide you with more task to do fill your time whilst wait for crop to grow   again so many negative review I see   player be turn these game mode off and then complain they have nothing to do in game and it s boring   well yeah that s go to happen   when you turn off half the game feature and option   you re not then play the game then be you   if you re go to turn off plough   lime spread   stone collect   mulching and weed   you might as well turn your game off and then your computer as well   because clearly this type of game be not for you   I see one reviewer who say nobody do mulch as there be no point to it   and nobody do weed   a statement that be very clearly factually incorrect   mulching remove the stubble leftover from previous harvest crop and introduce the material back into the soil   give you a bonus to your next crop harvest for field that you mulch before seed   so clearly not a pointless task   same go for weed   remove the weed be much easy in f    because you now get to use the mechanical weeder and single in game hoe for long to remove the weed and prevent you get a penalty on your next harvest   it s also a very relaxing thing to do in game after having seed or plant a field for a few hour and pass the time very nicely   so again would not describe it as a pointless function   especially when reviewer then go on to say they find they spend all their time sleep or fast wording time to find stuff to be able to do   well duh   you keep skip over all the task you could be do    for people who say farm sim     be well then farm sim      I typically check how many hour they have play the game and see many of these reviewer have play for less then      hour   which be nothing in a farm sim game   I see one review say they ve play every game from       to now and fs    be the good in the series   I check their steam profile and sure they have play every game but when add up their combine play time for every game it still be below       hour for the entire series   I play fs    alone for       hour and have      hour in f    at the time of this writing   I don t know how anyone can say this game be well or bad then the previous game when their profile show they haven t play it   I also find it hard to take anything seriously from someone with so many game in their steam library but they haven t reach triple figure playtime in any of they   indicate someone with a very short attention span or focus   or someone with too much money who can afford to jump from one game to the next late and great release and never play or complete anything    f    beat f    purely from the standpoint of the improved engine and performance   result in well looking game that run at high framerate on the same hardware as fs     the sound in fs    be so much well than in f     with all the various tractor and equipment sound so much meaty and more like their real life counterpart   you now get the different engine sound as vehicle be put under load and strain   you have the gearbox now on many vehicle so hear the transmission change   and then there be all the environmental sound change with trailer and tool that clank and clunk and make noise as they be move   trailer that have that knock sound each time they lower as the piston reach each stage of it s lower   a lot of small detail and tweak which when give a surface glance by a casual player or viewer they probably don t see or notice   but you definitely do when play it if you have play past game    multiplayer be so much well in farm sim      the data sync between player when player log in or leave a server be so much fast in this year game   no long do player on a server have to sit and wait for   syncronise datum between player   for ten minute whenever someone log onto the server   the delay might just literally be a    or    second pause now when a player connect   which do not interrupt and distract player as much now   also this year game be the first that allow crossplay between console player and pc player   no other farm sim game in the series allow this   also for the first time ever in the series   when join a server in farm sim     run mod   it s possible to download and synchronise those mod directly from the server page and be in game   provide the mod be on the in game giants modhub   no more have to back out of the game go to the modhub and manually try to remember what mod you need for a server and download they   I still think one area of improvement here though that giant could make for pc player host and run dedicated server be that on the mod page of their web interface   allow that screen to be sort either alphabetically by player or by most recently upload update so that when an admin add or update mod to a server which might not be on the the in game modhub and not available for auto download and sync in game   that player can find they and download they much more easily and quickly from the server s webinterface and public mod download page
this game be very relaxing   I m not obsess with farming at all   though I do like management simulator game   I honestly think I d burn out back in f    which be when I start   whenever I burn out   I literally put it down for a few month and it s like I m play it again for the first time when I pick it back up    with that out of the way   it s not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination   imho   you need to mod it heavily just to make it enjoyable or rather manageable on large scale   production and qol mod give the base game something more to do   it get boring very quickly once you overcome say the first year of farming    if you find the game too easy there s mod like maizeplus   animal food extension   etc   to make it hard    how about the dlc   most of it be nonsense     I m sorry   I love the game   I own the majority of they   and the implement look really cool like the new goweil pack or some of the old one but the goweil for instance doesn t support the large bale size   a previous dlc   vemeer   be dedicate to windrowe straw and some other stuff but it wasn t anyhing amazing   it s also somewhat silly as mod both official modhub and not add these thing   the premium edition just announce today add    crop     of which be already available on multifruit map   so be dlcs a cash grab   yea   duh     if you pay for it you do it to support the continued development and growth of the game and that s why I do it every so often but aside from the major expansion I wouldn t bother    another thing      in term of long term play   a   x   or standard   map be way too small after say      hour of continue play   you ll own it all by year      and this be fine whether you do or do not   a   x be probably where you ll want to start for long term play or if you just want to play on huge map with a lot of variability   this game by far give you no shortage of new way to play   but over half of it doesn t come from the developer directly   and they know this     heck they allow season to be a mod for an entire game before officially add it in        bale storage for    game till it become a thing a few month ago    lol   endrant    overall   if you bother to read all this   there s a ton of depth   but only if you add it in   the game will not just give it to you   I have to climb through almost    gb of mod map before I find my core group of mod that I ll always play with and rather than waste time do that yourself   there be quite a few content creator on youtube that ll show you these thing too   enjoy
buy heroin   it s less addictive
I like grass
I run over multiple people with a    ton tractor      its very fun
I have download and instal the game it keep freeze in game   I change my graphic set to low   turn off v sync   etc   and still same issue   after do some dig   I find a fix    the game be set to run with directx     by default   you can change it to directx     from the config file   to fix   d d    dll be miss from your computer   error   follow these step    navigate to document    my game    farmingsimulator      open the game xml file with notepad   change   renderer d d      renderer   to   renderer d d      renderer   save it and check if it work    this work for I   game run good now   hopefully this help any of you that may be have a similar issue   good luck farm   
have several hour in playtime currently there be quite a few improvement overall   I ve be play the fs series all the way back since        I do really like the game and be hype for it   but I feel like there could really be some improvement   this review be more along the line of be netural but I feel in the good interest to leave it as be positive for now as there s room for improvement    some pro     well graphic   somewhat well vehicle sound    quite a few choice for map    they all look nice and giant seem like they do a good job in detail they and etc      some vehicle handling and physics seem to be improve    ground texture and thing relate to that seem a bit well than fs      new grape and olive plant and equipment relate to all that    mack truck add to game that be license    production chain    con     for some weird and odd reason everytime I go to exit my game it never take I back to the main menu screen like it do in fs     this may very well be a bug but its get pretty annoying that it just exit and close the game completely and I have to click on the icon or go through steam to launch it again just to get back to the main menu    the in game builder be a bit horrible right now   when I try to place down a building or fence for instance   it never seem to be fully place on the ground or get place in a weird way and so far I can not find a way to adjust the object height placement like in fs       there s just not in my opinion that many more vehicle option compare to fs    and what giant advertise   while this be not a big deal and there be some new vehicle it just feel the same as fs    s vehicle option     it seem like the mack truck have a hard time try to drive and or switch through gear   I use an xbox controller and have all vehicle set to auto transmission and everytime I use a mack truck with a trailer or whatever it always win t go or get stuck when it really shouldn t at all and its quite frustrating at time    but give some of my pro and con and experience here   I be go to leave my review as recommend as its a very good game   it just need some improvement and thing to make it well   if your on f    still and be think of pick up f     I would say if your really into farming and simulation like I be most of the time   I would say its worth it overall for pick it up
it appear I m enjoy this game
drink beer and farm
for I review this game be not as binary as yes or no   and I ll explain why    I appreciate that giant have be develop this game since         I ve only play it since       but what I m not see be anything other than a reskin here and adaption of the good community mod into the main game   and not even all of they    positive      production pocesse be pretty cool   and add another dimension to the game along with season   although I seriously run out of steam try to play single player   it rebalance the value of various crop so it s worth grow pretty much anything     there s always a lot to do if you re play multiplayer so you re not go to get bore   I mean   I play once a week     the graphic be slightly shiny   I guess        but honestly I m not see a huge difference here    I could go on here but most of it be just mod from the previous game incorporate into the main title   notably season   global company   and courseplay   the thing be though   they haven t really add anything new to the game    I mean stuff that wasn t there before if you be all modde up   it s not a bad game   it s actually fun   it s just         numerous glare deficiency in the ui and game engine remain from the       version    which beg the question what be they do for    year   just brainstorm new dlc idea   here be just a few    game engine      extremely outdated and frankly hopeless physics    eg tree remain stand when you chop they down     idiotic ai   I mean don t expect a helper to do any job without you have to go back and do it again afterwards     limited graphical rendering after about      metre   it mean you can see field be harvest but by invisible tractor   and because object be render but crop aren t an object in the field be visible from far away but hide when you get close   this be only for starter   really     glitch   just everywhere    when it get dark it s like a    s movie when they shoot in the daytime but turn the brightness down   it s rubbish    clearly a new game engine be need   and I be expect it for      give the time they spend on it    instead it s just a re skin   all the exact same problem remain    ui      in       setting be remember from session to session for each vehicle   for example for courseplay and for gps    it s particularly annoying with courseplay when you have to disable the right click pop up every single login   or gps when you have to turn the line on every time you use it    when it come to courseplay none of the peopole I play with can work out how to use it in game    the mod from       be actually way easy to use   I miss they     there be still no mouseover or such like tell you what each of the crop symbol represent   or some such   as a casual player this be a pain in the     well you know what it s a pain in   which one be wheat        the finance screen still only give you the last    day   month   whatever    and no breakdown beyond the most simplistic     the shop screen be improve by be able to see related vehicle   but it s still hard to find anything    generally speak it feel like the ui be design as a mish mash for both console and pc   the resolution give that away as it s not configure at all for high re screen with even small icon than before   if you want to be multi platform one size fit all doesn t work   you think they d learn that by now    it s also be simplify    animal do not require water   I mean really     and produce few product   eg cow no long produce manure    this be clearly drive by cross platform requirement   but why   if I want a playstation game I d buy a playstation   but I don t   I want a grow up pc game please    what I wish it have       a proper sim element   that this be miss be just lazy   you could have full historical breakdown of what you ve sell   when you ve sell it   how much   your income   graph   chart   all sort of cool stuff   all the data be there in their database   you could have all sort of info you could actually use to make your farm more efficient   instead there be the same useless rolling week by week update from the last game   to move from just a driving around in tractor sim to actually be a farming sim surely this have to be address   it s a massive disappointment and miss opportunity in the game   which would not be difficult at all to implement   railroad tycoon in       have well   actually   sim city in       have well   there be no excuse     an new graphic engine   the current one be glitchy   the physics be terrible   and it slow down at the slight provocation   tree be still ridiculous   the default in multiplayer be you can t have more than      pallet in the game   in a production base game   then try it with    people   it take about a day before you hit the limit   but once you go beyond it you see why   try move a load of pallet at once   you ll see     well server   nobody would disagree     have anyone try remove olive tree   how do you even do that     what the game didn t need      more process   do anyone really have lime   periodic ploughing   stone   weed switch on all the time   do anyone roll their field   just get the basic right please giant   then add more stuff for we to turn off     conveyor belt you have to sit in to operate    be this even a thing   factorio would be in trouble with this mechanic     more dlcs   platinum be out soon   surely that s just a bunch of feature the base game should have have when it be rush out in the first place    now the modding community be catch up      no thank guy    I enjoy this game   I play this game regularly   but it be no well than its predecessor   in some way it be actually bad   I would say it s a disappointment   but it s not because it be entirely expect   so I ll just call it another miss opportunity to create something great
  graphic     miserable    ultra bad    average     beautiful    perfect    breathtake    the graphic have definitely improve and be definitely well than in the predecessor   a few visual bug be present   but these will surely be fix   with the new texture   the game look quite a bit more realistic again   see for yourself and compare it to the predecessor   fs    have earn its name as a simulator     audio     earrape    bad    average    good     fantastic    be I still in the game or really there       bad    nothing special    average     beautiful    as beautiful as this review                          everyone        very low system    low system     average    strong system    very strong system    supercomputer from nasa        very easy    easy    normal    hard    as hard as dark soul       ultra quickly play through    quickly play through    average    sufficient     endless        your money fly into the trash can    I m rich anyway   so I don t care     wait until it be on sale    be worth    this price be worth it in any case       as always   the game convince with its fleet of car and feature   in fs    you have season and there be finally cross play with the console   you can now play and enjoy f    together more easily than ever before   the helper system have be significantly expand   but still have some weakness   all in all   f    be a worthy successor   and as for the bug   they will surely be fix bit by bit in the come week     after almost     hour of play I still can t understand the negative review   so far I haven t have any major bug   the game run smoothly and it hasn t crash at startup or while play   for I   farming simulator     have make a great start   if people think there be no big difference you should compare the graphic and don t forget that farming simulator     use a completely improve engine
today be one week after the initial release of the fs    game   and I ve be go back and forth try to sort my thought about this release   I didn t want to write a review just after release   but now   without an update on the game after a week of official release    I see that there be no reason for a polite wait    I ve be a true fan of the fs game since     and      and have see the game evolve   on     I have around a thousand hour   and have be really invest in the game   it have help I a lot have a game where you can immerse yourself and have a break from real life stuff and be farmer for an hour or two   I come to understand that giant have make some kind of schedule by year when make the game   and people really think f    be go to be a thing    but during the fs    era they state that they want an extra year to work on the upcoming game   and be not plan a release of a fs    game   the community accept this as a good reason for delay a release   I think we expect more from this statement   and didn t understand that this be a delay to release several dlcs for the fs    game   small equipment pack    and under some circumstance it would have be a good thing to release dlcs for the fs    game   if it have bring some significant to the game    but it really didn t     of the dlcs be small addition of equipment in one select brand   holmer   anderson   bourgault   grimme   rottne   john deere cotton and kverneland   and the two other be   expansion   of alpine and platinum   the first add a handful of equipment   and a poorly make alpine map   where none of the field be in the actual alpine     and the last one of platinum just add some claas equipment   all these dlcs come to a total of almost      usd eur extra to the already purchase game of around        usd eur   giant be on a roll    but look past the half a   ed work that giant put into the dlcs that be release   the community recognize the potential of the game   the modder and map maker of fs    rise to stardom   it have to be the only community I know of that actually take a game to such new level with their modding skill   and it be not a closed off modding community   giant have their own mod page both on their site and ingame where the approve mod be release   so giant have be very well aware of what be make and which mod be the most download and use    fast forward to late       and the upcoming release of fs     the community be so excited   of course we be   we be still live off the high that fs    give we   and we be all play our modded version with both courseplay   gps   season and probably a map from oxygendavid   fs    just have to be the next level    now   after see some gameplay from the influencer that receive the press release   and after play for a week on the two new map   in total of three   erlengrat be with we still   the   alpine   map    I have to say I m really confused   I see a lot of new feature   all of which giant have take from their modding community   the graphic be mostly the same   but that s not a terrible thing because the fs    graphic be still good   but all the new feature bring with they a whole heap of bug   reddit have make a gigathread of all the report bug on the game   and you can really scroll through that thread to see the mess this be   many of the bug be game breaking   and giant haven t bother release hot fix to they a week after the release   I don t like be a cap lock andy   but since they take an extra year to work on it   put it up for pre purchase with an extra of    year season pass in total of     usd eur for the game and pass    some point have to be in cap lock    so yeah   what can I say   I expect more giant   I really do   and I think you owe more to this community that stick with you through all the release   and if this be something you finish   sit back and say   yes   this be good   release it    and expect to receive praise    then this thumb down be really fitting as a response   do well   we know you can       good graphic    improve bale and pallet interaction    fresh and modern overhaul of the ui    implementation of manual gearbox    new feature   although the modder should have be credit       bug throughout the game    game break bug that could have be fix through hot fix    problem with equipment   season   game function   map and more     just read the megathread over at   r farmingsimulator to get the whole list      never   under no circumstance pre purchase a game   never   and as the game stand today   just continue your favorite save on fs    and we ll give you a beep when they clean up their mess

so I ve be play fs since      this be a good game although it be nothing groundbreake like the     be      be essentially a copy of     with public develop mod add   then     be essentially     with the more public mod add   some new feature and convenience add   the game generally look well   I guess   the main issue I have be that they have not add deformable terrain and realistic mud   when you plow a field   it need to deform and it would be awesome to bulldoze a log road on the side of a mountain   this just need to happen   maybe still year away but I m not buy any more of these game until there be more than just cosmetic change and public mod add that they try to resell for

trakter
relax with a tractor   or panic in one as everything go wrong
I be a farmer myself and can share with you that the economic difficulty in this game be not the same as in real life   but the game give people a little perspective of some of the work actually need in order to be a farmer   it still miss a lot of thing   but be understandable why it s not include in the game   compare with the previous farming simulator game throughout the year   f    have improve graphic and physics   a lot of work in physics be still need when it come to pallet    log or anything else that have to do with front loader and crane   I also miss a lot of tractor   but thankfully it be a lot easy now with the downloadable content menu inside the game   in previous version   you have to download these manually from the internet   where they often didn t work as intend   other than that   it be a great game with a good concept
the definite dawn of farming simulator     be less and less   simulator    play since a few gen back     new   feature   be      cut and bad version of most popular mod from previous iteration look up season mod from      forestry   forage and bailing now sell as   dlc   straight out and bad than maizeplus mod be     the game engine be old and limited   driving and implement s physics can be barely call physics   graphic be refresh and still optimization be tragic    instead of work on actual   new   feature it be obviously way more profitable to sell dlc s that be   as state before   mostly mod that be already there before    some content be actually cut out of the next game compare to previous one and than re introduce as dlc s   mostly pay it be really sad to see this   as this be   and in spite of absolute lack of competition still be   the only viable farming game on the market   what seem to be a develop simulator become a model   we sell untill they buy   game   until some major change take place in the next release   it seem it s my last farming simulator game   as there be simply barely anything new from generation to generation
after      hour in just about a year this game in now due a review from I its not just another farming game theirs so much you can do alot more option compare to fs     and other thing you can make the game completely customisation to you it dosen t have to be another arcade game you can play as realistically as you want from tractor stick in the mud to wiper you have to manually turn on equipment you have to manually attach and honestly its be a great game the community be also amazing meeting brilliant people who be allay helpful kind friendly willing to help play with even talk to this game be brilliant in the fact you cvan work as a team or be by yourself singe miley sirus while drive along at    mph cultivate your freild as the sun set on some brilliant map then up again the next day at    to feed the cow least I can do all this from the comfort of my home        brilliant game

my gambling addict friend say if I post a review on farming simulator     and it get      like and      award that he will buy I a case of beer and some vodka so I m just go to leave this here
currently while write this review   I have      hour in this game   the graphic have greatly improve   as have the drive mechanic   vehicle actually feel like they have weight and power   the suspension finally act properly   little detail   such as the seat suspension be able to be see in   rd person   be a nice addition   the amount of work involve be increase   which be great   the inclusion of thing like the crop calendar   build mechanic   etc    add to the great experience   this be definitely a must buy if you like farm simulator game   or even simulation game in general
in this farming simulator     we have a lot of improvement   which be the physics   the sound of the vehicle   the sound environment   the manual gearbox   the season with snow   the rendering of the map which be really more detailed   this which make the immersive side excellent     regard multiplayer   the addition of crossplay and the addition of voice chat be obviously greatly appreciate     be player of the license since fs     the game have evolve well since      each new version be a masterpiece     it s a great game   you win t regret it
I don t get what it be with farming simulator that be so bloody addictive   there s zero story   and the gameplay be by definition a repetitive grind   yet here we be   a week after launch   and it s eat     hour of my life in that time   the mod community be already pour out new content   and although there be little bug and annoyance in the game this early after launch   I have no doubt they ll be fix soon    highly recommend for anyone who enjoy a good sim
I recommend this     if you watch someone else play this first before you try it yourself   there be no way you can do the    hour refund trick to demo this game   after    hour you will have maybe figure out how to plow a field while keep straight line   and also because this be not a game   I classify this in the category it s not fun   it s addictive   so make sure you can get addicted to this    I don t have much with farming but watch other people play I see that it have some depth to it so I decide to make this my time filler while I take a break from my usual   after a rough start try to find my way through the slightly ambiguous ui   it take I way long to figure out how to sell chicken than be necessary      and have trouble figure out what all the machine be for   I start to get the hang of it   the tutorial be dreadful by the way   I learn to play by do two false start where I just throw away money buy random machine and learn how to use they before I start the third serious playthrough    and after     hour of play   I     kind of go back on my claim that it have depth   it have some depth   but not as much as I think it have   to I it feel like an incomplete sim   a beta version for the full release which might just be farm sim         part of the game feel rather complete   you can plant grain and other good   harvest they and they form feed for animal   material for other product in a product chain or you can just sell they on their own   that s fine   except its extreme busy work because to properly prepare a field you need to plow cultivate it   fertilize it twice   roll it   optionally remove large stone   lime it and remove weed   good god   I would really recommend turn off stone   that be just one grind too many   thankfully the game be very configurable    you can let task be do by the computer so you can multitask   or you can do multiplayer   a common thing to do be that one do harvesting and the other drive a truck next to it to collect the product so the harvester never have to stop to be empty   it s just     the ai be dumber than a doorstop   one tree and they will ram themselves right into it and get stick   they get stuck on corner so you can t trust they to even drive your equipment from a to b successfully   under develop to say the least    but I want to do a chicken farm   and     chicken be in my eye really under develop too   you buy they   pretty cheap   to be honest    they magically transport themselves to your coop and if you just keep the food storage from go empty   they will on their own grow   multiply and produce egg which you can sell or put into a production chain   and that s it   that s chicken   if the coop didn t radiate some clucking sound I would confuse they for be plant   it be almost passive especially if you compare it to grow crop   oh yeah you have the option of put rooster in your coop so the chicken multiply fast   but truth be tell     you don t need they   chicken multiple like gremlin in a swimming pool already    there be more you can do   you can do forestry which be kind of a cheat way to get money quick   but the game need that because otherwise you d be leave with only the option of cheat your way into money with mod   or take out huge loan and have they be a pain in the neck   in the official map the devs hide collectable all around which be worth a thousand buck a pop so if you manage to find they   and they be not well hide   that s a few free cheap machine right there   you have greenhouse which be largely passive if you provide they with water   if you install mod you can do thing like solar panel to make passive money   on the planting side of thing you can plant cotton and setup field of olive and grape which have their own unique way of prep and harvesting   you can plant root vegetable like potato and beet   but they be a massive pain in the neck to harvest   it take for e ver and you need specialized harvester to do so which be very slow   you can also do grass which be food for animal   or turn it into hay or silage   a lengthy multi step process require several machine and transport    long story short   lot to do     it be kind of fascinating because of the many different machine you get to drive around and use but a pretty shallow experience nonetheless   I be a little disappointed   I have more fun watch other people play it while they edit their video to skip over the wait part than I have play it myself where there be no skipping
farming simulator     be an outstanding addition to the series   offer an immersive and detailed farming experience   with over      hour of gameplay   I ve find the game both engage and rewarding
there be a zen that helps center I   I grow up on a farm   this take I back to my root
if you have tell I I be go to invest almost      hour of game time in a farm sim I would ve say you be nuts   but here we be   this feel like more than just a farm sim   not only be farm involve but there be so much more that can keep you glue to your screen   you have to manage your money   crop schedule   animal   production   asset and credit   equipment and I m sure there s more that I haven t even touch yet   the amount of depth for this game be quite incredible   I know nothing about farming but I find this pretty user friendly   the community have plenty of resource available to get you start   be it a perfect game   no   but any game that keep I interested enough to play for     hour as of today be a pretty great game   highly recommend
I be a     year old father   probably one of the old people play this game   I be a single father to my son   who be now      my son recently download f    and in less than a week   he have already play for over     hour   this be terrible for I   as it be already hard enough for I to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch video on youtube   so I decide to get the game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game but I be stick on what you where suppose to do   I ask my son for help and he host a game for I to join   I love it as it be the good time I have spend with he since my wife get sick   this game have ever since bring my son and I close again and now we actually spend time together   this game remind I that there s fun to be have in everything   even farming   and it have bring both I and my boy some enjoyable hour
the game itself be fantastic   some minor bug   but a great experience to play   so why the negative   because of the purchase option   if you can afford it   buy the premium bundle   with the year    and    pass include   also be aware you can not but any other bundle if you already own a part of the game    edit      steam support wasn t really helpfull blame it on giant policy and giant support have still to anwser my case   I open    week ago   even big fail from their side   give up on the game within steam and buy it directly from giant   they give you a key code and     download   which you have to individually install and enter the key   far from ideal   but I can enjoy the game again        my mistake to have buy the platinum edition   think to upgrade to the premium edition later   turn out this be not a complete your bundle   fine my mistake   cost I     euro and I ll just buy the complete premium bundle additional for     euro s   nope   once you own part of the game you be not allow to buy any bundle   mean you have to spend the full price of the premium upgrade     euro   the year    pass     euro and the year    pass another     euro   so an additional     euro s while the premium bundle be just        even delete the game from your library will lock you out of buy a different bundle   because you previously own part of that bundle     steam and giant   please get this sort   because from the web I read this be a very old issue and very annoying as I have not be able to purchase what I want for two day now and I completely lose access to the game     the game be a beauty   the trailer and tractor look really good   lot of detail and move part   the option what to do in game be endless   from take care of the field   animal   transport your good to be a lumberjack   extensive mod and server support with even more detail   the gameplay be addictive and build your farm really reward    some issue I run into where the g    steering wheel deadzone at      in the setting   this mean the first     degree your steering wheel do nothing    which be a weird default choice   adjust this resolve the issue until you plugin to a different usb port and this get reset   quite often load cargo doesn t work   switch to another vehicle and back fix this   terrain manipulation tool be a straight drama   place building will smooth out the area   but be will cause huge bump in the terrain which most of the time can not completely be even out
I m new to this series   I think the idea sound kind of outside the thing I want to know about or play in a game   and here I be       hour in   this be the most peaceful and relax thing I ve play in a long while   and at the same time   stressful and hard as I have have to learn what everything be   do   and how to use it   I ve learn more about farming than I ve know my entire life and I m kind of proud of that    this game have great graphic that put you in the feeling of run a harvester   plow a field   cut grass   trucking good   you name it   it strive for realistic machine though the town themselves be pretty lifeless   the season view as time pass be also quite beautiful   as be the sunset across a field while you re wind down for the day         audio be decent and workable for what this game be   but again   you re listen to bird and machinery   thankfully there be a build in radio that play not just can music but also stream from several public music station   allow for some good jam as you wind around in your tractor         gameplay be strangely addictive   this isn t a baron style game where you re force to compete   really   this be a wide open map   of several   where you slowly expand your farm empire   the only thing stop you be your ability to take on more work and learn new thing   it s true open gameplay in that you don t have to do anything at all and the sim will gladly let you pass time just to watch the season if you want   but it also allow you to enjoy learn thing you might know very little about   one step at a time   be that farming   log   raise farm animal   or do work for other   the map be your canvas to play and expand on   there isn t much   if any   pressure   but it have that    one more thing    feel in spade   it have that hook that keep pull you back to check on thing and go another month or three   that s the mark of an excellent game          multiplayer be available for those that run or rent dedicated server   I have not try that yet but it s quite popular with those who do and one of the highlight of the series   joint farming with friend         don t pass by this if you re even remotely interested in the idea   this be a fantastic and relax game

despite more than      critical report bug in f    over      year   the game remain incredibly buggy   unfinished   and performance be still terrible   as giant continue on their effort to prove to the whole world how utterly incompetent and unprofessional they be by refuse to acknowledge the buggy mess they ve create   the game still require a good dozen mod to work properly and be at all enjoyable to play for more than a few hour   if it wasn t for the modder   every version of farming simulator would be a ginormous waste of time and money   fs    include   for a company that s do nothing but release the same game over and over for     year with only negligible and barely noticeable change   it s mindblowingly mystify that they flat out refuse to work on that very same game   instead of work on their only product   giant instead focus on procure license for as many brand as possible   with zero consideration for how relevant those product be to the game   thus we have a dozen   buggy   dlc where the majority be effectively repaint of exist stuff and thus not remotely worth the price tag   despite of these issue   the game be now officially abandon and will never be complete   as giant be now about to release the next enumeration of this game    for fs     giant spend a year in lockdown rip off mod   while fail to adequately credit the more than two dozen mod creator for their work   thus what make fs    different from fs    be      the work of modder   there be no graphical improvement over previous game   no performance improvement   it still fail to utilize the hardware properly   and it be by far the most buggy version of fs yet as giant stop support the base game within a month after release and instead shift all their limit resource to develop dlc   for a game that remain broken and only barely function as intend    the overall performance problem remain the big problem   thank to the game run everything off a single cpu core    despite giant promise multithreaded performance improvement for fs     this design   or lack thereof   mean the framerate still tank massively at random for no explicable reason   the game be also still unstable and it be very easy to get it to lock up just by having more than      helper go at the same time   and because the game only run on a single core   throw high performance hardware at it make zero difference   the game simply can t utilize it    speak of helper   they re if anything bad than ever   just as useless as they ve be in the past     year since the system be introduce to fs     but now they re even more glitchy and will happily stop in the middle of a field for   unknown error    they still win t stay on the field   they still turn around in crop and need a whole field to turn around because they don t know how to make    point turn   they        about stuff   in the way   way outside the field where they shouldn t be go anyway   they win t follow the edge of the field   and the list go on and on    the pile of problem with these game keep get big with each release because giant refuse to fix anything before release the next buggy dlc   which mean each release and each   update   result in an even buggy and broken game than the last
this game be very addict   it can be very easy and fun or very in depth   however you want to play it   my grandson and I love to play it together
I ve only play a couple hour but so far so good
I have no idea why I play a virtual farming game to earn virtual money and buy virtual tractor
great game with ability to mod to make well
giants software have year of experience make farming simulator   but apparently they still can t make an ai that can properly work on field     f    ai even get confuse by perferctly rectangular field   a massive step back from fs     I really can not understand that   
  hahaha   its farm simulator   what an alpha dork nerd     I get it   and yea   that be I too for the long time   I think why would anyone play that    now that I have it   I have to admit its a surprisingly good game   you can even play it when be braindead   and that be partly why it be so successfull   there be nothing complex or difficult about it   yet you have a lot of thing to do and can build on your plot of land what you want and how you want it   that mean you have quite some creative freedom to do thing how you like   on top   the game be very open to modde so you can adjust the game to what you want it to be rather easylie   for most thing there be at least one mod    and in hard mode start from scratch    the economy be   to my surprise   quite tight   you operate on smal margin for a long time and I enjoy that   you have to dig yourself out of the financial hole for some time and what you spend your virtual money on do make a difference for many gameplay hour   for a long time you can not afford all you   want   but only one thing at a time   so what s it gona be   yes   hard mode be grindy in that sense   but grindy in a good way for my taste    the easy and normaly difficulty   I never try those   I guess you roll in money more quickly there   in short   the game be a big surprise for I   and with a ton of mod map I can seem myself play it some more in the future

outdated visual fidelity   expensive season pass   additional dlcs   same bug in the game for month or year   I play it quite a bit   but not because it be the good farming simulator    because it be the    only one     other have try but be even bad    I get it   it be hard and expensive to make one   it get very technical very quickly   but the lack of competition in the farm sim genre be very noticeable   innovation have stagnate and the idea be just be milk by giant for eternity     pun intend   p   so   big thumb up for simply exist   thumb up for the active modding scene   thumb down for the outdated engine   thumb down for lack of continue refinement and another thumb down for their monetization effort   pretty much the ea playbook      leave I with a thumb down overall   even though I would choose neutral   if there would be an option like this
this game steal my heart   I be engage to a nice woman whom I have meet in my young year   she be a good fit for I and I enjoy be with she   but then I see the trailer to this game   it be then that I discover that I deserve well   every romeo must meet their juliette   as soon as I see that big green john deere     s with dynamic tread imprint and a front loader attachment   I know   right then   that farm simulator     be the one   I drop my old girlfriend and pursue my new love interest   as it stand   we be in a happy relationship   she really let I plant my soybean in the summer heat   if you know what I mean   I plan to devote thousand of hour   perhaps the remainder of my existence   to farm simulator   wedding invitation be be make   if anyone be interested   thank you for all the memory make   and the one that be still to come   I love you   farming sumulator

it take a bit of time to get into gear with farm simulator      but now I m enjoy the game   I come from american truck simulator and euro truck simulator     which I still love    I have not play any of the farm simulator game from the past   at first   I be overwhelm by the game   I didn t know where to start   unfortunately   the guide tour in game didn t help much   but after watch some   professional   play on youtube   like daggerwin   I get my bearing and get to work   so   don t give up on f    at first   it s worth the effort

I like tractor
as a farmer of     year I do love this game
who know clocking out of work and clock into farming simulator where you virtually work would be so much fun   joke aside   this be an extremely relaxing game that you can spend hour on end play   there be something about the creative freedom and the ability to throw wood in the bed of a truck or use a gradall to dump hay into a trough for cow that be extremely satisfying   just you   your creative headspace   and the land   very quality game with massive mod support which help replayability tremendously   for all of the complex mechanic this game have to offer   they do so without many    if at all    bug   the game be extremely playable and well put together   thank you devs
having never farm a day in my life I can t say how realistic it be   it seem pretty convincing to I   but when be a game too realistic   be this even a game   to I this be like desert bus   it take realism to the extreme and it s not try to be fun   of course that be a joke game and this be serious    I get that a lot of people like it   I love sim too but this just take it too far   if farm in real time and endlessly drive over the same field be what you want in a game or if you want the good farming sandbox ever make you ll love this   but it s not for everyone   for I it get well after I adjust setting and instal some mod to take away some of the realism and combine some of step to relive the tedium    it seem like all the you tuber do the same thing   it s almost like the entire community silently agree that this game be unplayable without some mod for all but the most hard core   I play     hour and barely scratch the surface   start try mod about half way through and eventually get bore frustrated enough with it that I rage uninstalle    I m still give it a thumb up because most of what be there be do well   maybe too well   a story mode that both teach you how to farm and give some sort of progression would have really help I think   it s a great simulator   they just forget to include the game
edit as of jan         the game seem to be playable on a dedicated server now   be play      hour over without any of the problem list below   with the current price tag of       I would recommend to consider buy it     original    I ve be play this for hour upon hour since fs     and it have always be riddle with bug and crappy phsyic   all that be fine by I    it s kinda charming after all   what be not fine by I be giant publish a game that be not in a playable state if you want to play with your friend    my friend and I have try different hosting service for our dedicated   the common theme for all of they   you ask   none of they actually let we save the progress we make   I really want to recommend this game at this point   as multiplayer be a crucial part of the fun    the report of trouble with multiplayer saving start to come in december        four month ago when write this review   in none of the forum thread giant have show any effort to tell we when it will be fix   possible work around and so forth   that s not okay   not for a game charge a premium price from it s customer    I might change this review in the future if the issue be resolve   but for now I don t recommend anyone splash      on this game
you see I farm   they hatin   patrollin   and tryna catch I ridin   dirty
well than my ex
great way to escape the real world problem and relax
I be really enjoy play fs    as much if not more then fs      with all the different way you can play from totally real to totally nut    but like f    this game would not be so great if it be not for the great modder who add so much to the game play    its not just the mod that be test by giant its the small one off mod that I love    so if you be look for a great chill out game or a game with so much to do you can only just keep up fs     be both      happy farming all     
such a zen game series   easy to lose hour and hour   highly recommend
for when you can t afford land or machinery   but want to farm
so I buy this game    now its a lifestyle
note   this will change to positive once certain fix have be apply   I d rate it neutral if I could    it s a good game but there be quite a lot of game   immersionbreaking flaw currently   even though I don t have regret I can t recommend it yet   but I m certain it will get well with time    pro    fun gameplay   the idea be great as always   it s the go to farm sim    sound be well   map be cool   sense of progression   relax   con    bug like broken tree that change visually to window medium player screensaver if you cut they in certain angle    break tree that crash your game and make it unloadable   sometimes it work if you try enough time though     drive physics and handling be horrible in my opinion   to I the tree be also awkward to do forestry with   sometimes the physics go       when hold pallet you can ascend to the sky when jump   ai driver work mostly but aren t the most mentally gifted invidual    this depend on opinion and preference   the progression and make money be really slow   you can disregard this if you don t agree   some variation in certain tool and vehicle would be great but this problem solve with mod eventually   if I could reverse time I would wait for sale and fix
I m have fun with the game   but the crappy ai be really cut into the way I want to play the game   I want to play the game like a management sim where I m get farmhand work the farm and run job here and there   keep everything go   in reality a worker can barely handle drive from one field to the next let alone drive across the map or handle deliver anything   this have make the game more of a sim where you the player do everything and sometimes can get the ai to do the absolute most simple task like plow a field   but even then that doesn t always go well    I might give farming simulator     a look because the ai be advertise to actually work in that game but I m a bit bummed that it didn t work out in this one
a wise man once say   to forget how to dig the soil   tend the earth   be to forget ourselves   well maybe some have   but a few of we still know   you get to be willing to put in the time   make the sacrifice   and the hard choice   the job s get its perk   don t get I wrong   the sweet smell of the morning dew   the way the warm sun and the cool breeze can dance across your skin   but don t think it s a game   the farm s get a way of sort the wheat from the chaff   just remember to keep your wit about ya   you fall    you get back up again   because this be more than just a job   it s a calling   who else would choose to wake up early in the morning   tear up their hand work in the field all day   and then spend the evening planning how they re go to do it all over again    well    tomorrow   day after day   season after season   year after year   that s a calling that s never end   it stretch far forward and back from we as long as farmer have be tend this earth   and farmer will be around as long as such a thing exist   tomorrow will be secure by those willing to dirty their hand today   so when you feel alone out there in the field   just remember   you re not   think about all those that have come before you    and all those that will follow   plant today   harvest tomorrow
I wanna take a loan and start my farm in real life thank to the incredible series until I watch clarkson s farm n realize how hard it really could be
traktor
fun
so far the game have be completely different to     even though some say its just a re skin but the aspect of all the production chain and new machine brand as well as the new animal this game have keep I super busy manage the farm   there be a few bug to iron out but I m sure giant will do that in the come week or next year as its nearly xmas   now to wait for the awesome modding community to port mod from     to   
m I l f     man I love farm
it s good
it s a great game   but it get boring after some time   play with friend can be great fun   however   the ai hire help be very dumb and run into fence and tree
the good iteration of farming simulator yet   many new addition along with a few minor disappointment   while I ve list a fair number of negative point   in no way be this version bad than     overall   I have no wish to go back to     personally   there s nothing miss here that     have that I miss other than some tractor which I imagine may show up with free dlc later   some have already      many more machine and implement   we re not talk a dozen here   there s a lot more include electric vehicle option which be new to the franchise     new realism thing like collect rock from field and mulch     new shift ability for equipment with manual transmission     no more odd graphical glitch in the medium distance which have be persistent with the fs engine     snow   this be new to this version   personally I don t care for it much   but I m add it as a plus as it s a realism thing and many will probably like it   in some way it be poorly implement however and need work   see below     new calendar base year   certain crop must be plant harvest at certain time   much more realism     season   something the game have need for a while and require modder to implement   now it s embed     as other fs game before it   fs      support mod   mod can greatly enhance some aspect of the game      while there s far more equipment   some be miss   my favorite small medium tractor   be valtra and almost all model be miss   why   some case model be miss as well   only one track option for the new holland t   tho that s still well than f    which have none     snow have a graphic glitch on some system that have yet to be fix   it cause some flicker around the edge   usually reload the game fix it   but it can be a nuisance on some system     while snow be a positive overall   it s poorly implement   you don t leave track   the snow ice be slippery but the physics be odd   often it s not slippery when it should be and be when it shouldn t   snow in field doesn t affect equipment at all     there be still no reason to use track or duel wheel outside of what you want to look at   the large heavy equipment can still be pull with single tire no prob        some of the negative above can be fix with mod   but often they do a mediocre job    I be probably miss a few thing to compare against old iteration of the game   but these be the thing that stand out to I the most   if you love other version of fs   I don t think there s any reason not to get this   if thing like snow bug you for any reason such at the above mention glitch   you can turn it off

I like tractor
this game take my soul and sell it to the devil   of course in exchange for a brand new combine         would recommend
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               here I will leave this beautifull capybara   whoever pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up   I need steam point
      hour log in the good machine vehicle task roleplay game ever make   over         mod out there to tinker with   endless map   vehicle choice   it also double as the good farming sim on the market   which for some   be a plus   the fs modding community will continue to outdo the game developer in every single way   be play since f    on ps   so this be like breathe oxygen for the first time
I have always like farming simulator game   these be so relax   you don t have to rush or think too much   play couple of minute or spend hour   it s up to you   many possibility to modify your farm or equipment   take easy or hard challenge   several fine map to play   and it s evolve every day thank s to modhub and active community    it can t be total realistic but it s a game   you still can learn to grow and harvest and even use several equipment   which you have no opportunity in real world   in game you realize how hard and long way our food take before it be on the table    good game   try it and find little farmer inside of you
there be ton of bug   and very little add to the game engine since        in general map be large and some of the community mod have be integrate into the base game   that s all   few cosmetic change    adjust terrain be completely break   you can not make proper flat area   tree grow back under the heighten terrain   farm fence float in the air   impossible steep corner around road to name a few   good luck work with crate   often they get stuck or just fly into the cloud while hold it      I expect a lot more giant     your game follow the path of fifa nfl f    and similarly charge you with shtload of dlcs   season pass and pay dedicated server   shame on you
it s farming   but simulate

I recommend but we need vr support
pretty good but I feel like it would be well with a sex update
what the duck giant     why do you not allow an upgrade from standard to the premium edition   include   year    and    season pass and the class saddle track   I buy the game for        and need to pay        mor to get the season    and    pass     why should I pay        extra if I can use a second steam acc and only pay         for   the base game   year    and    season pass and the class saddle track     this be the most         move I wouldn t have expect from giant   deeply disapointe giants    game be great but the money make machienery be not   recommend and not at the same time
this game be my zen place the combination of a fantastic base game and their open arm embracing of modding and the community surround have make this game into one of my true favorite    I would absolutely recommend this game
what I really   not just like   but love about this game be the ultimate freedom to do whatever you want in term of organize your field and farm   the gameplay and graphic be raise to a really high level   the drive simulation be very close to reality   and since all kind of modification be allow   you can easily make your gaming experience absolutely real with a few click    manual attachment equipment   manual loading   realistic fueling   point of view   etc   n   another very strong aspect   at least for I as a gamer   be the behavior of the simulation when use hydraulic machine    especially when you have a joystick in your hand   the game react extremely adequately transfer your real command to the machine you control   the same of course also apply to the steering wheel and pedal when you use they the thing I would like to see improve be the difficulty of the game   even on the high set difficulty   without use any mod that bring easy money   or that allow the purchase of machine with unrealistic parameter or too cheap one   still within a season or two the game progress extremely quickly and can easily reach a state    I have nothing more to do and no more challenge before I   if anyone be interested   you can watch some of the video I make while develop my farm  
   get this as a gift from a friend   along with the season pass   easily addict   please be careful if you do virtual class as I do   you will absolutely get distract by virtual tractor
don t get I wrong   the game be awesome and one of a kind    when modde and play with friend   the inclusion of season and company in vanilla game be awesome   but the game have just not improve enough overall from f    to recommend this one   the only reason I choose to pick f    be it s ai   still one of the bad ai in all game imaginable   but since there be no similiar game to fs we can skip this one    what be mainly concern be no change to vehicle physics mainly when you lift off gas   the vehicle stop almost on dime   the inability to sit with a friend in one vehicle that have more than one seat   gear shift   awesome addition     it would be if developer would have ever see a manual transmission   the shifting be just    weird   hard to think of that a modder in fs    do a well job    when consider that the release have be delay and the price this game come at   it s a big let down   if you be a farming sim fan and be ready to mod the hell out of this game go for it as it be really one of a kind game rn   but other than than I can only recommend this game in a huge sale

become farmer
it s an excellent and challenging game
quite good   I like eat the grass
pousse pousse pousse les bons gros legumes   miam miam miam j ai hate d en manger
least buggy release this year
literally the good game ever   I play a lot of shooter before which be kinda sweaty and also frustrating if you lose   but this game isn t something like that   it s just a relaxing and extremely fun game   you might think what joke of a game farming simulator be if you watch it for the first time but once you ve start play you uncover the depth and the wide possibility that game have to over
at first I laugh at my comrade for play what I see as an absolute borefest   the mocking and bad farm joke slowly fade though as I watch their stream for nearly    day before buy it and what a masterpiece   you do not know financial ruin quite as much until good old farmer kamel sink a    ft trailer full of fresh produce into a french river   have to watch as million of lovely free range egg float away to paris   do you know egg that be fresh will float    I highly recommend this game to everyone   it will be the most fun you will have without a gun or a steal car I promise   also play with friend for maximum fun timesh
I ve play since farming simulator     on the xbox       so I think I can say that I m qualified to say   this game be amazing   it be such a good game and especially with mod it be so fun   you can really lose track of time just sit there play   if your a fan of past game you don t even need to read review   you will love it   and if your new   there be a reason this game sell so well   but     if you don t need it right now   I would hold out until fs    in november and save some money
yet another installment of   same as last release   thing giant be tout as a huge accomplishment for the new release   season        except its not as good as the fs    modde version   no ground temp   no geo s   so if you want a climate like australia or southern america    f off you get whatever vanilla climate they set it for    grape and olive       literally no one want this   production chain       so you take the global company mod from      and make this joke   update ground texture        okay    so you finally do what should have be do in fs     update sound       okay   cool   thank    thing fs fan want but didn t get   physics        bale and log be still janky af and jump all over the place   more physic      how about real ground physics   like the field be wet and your plow suck you to the ground     good luck get out   a decent season replication      the one they implement isn t horrible   its just not as good   see above geo rant   gps       how be this still not in the game   smart ai worker        again   they say they do well      but courseplay on fs    and     still beat out whatever crap giant make   more equipment      like how about some old stuff   surely you don t need a license from a dead manufacturer to replicate their stuff   use equipment sale      good try giant   that s a crap effort   make a tractor house computer terminal and the player can buy whatever they want from that   not your random offering ability to herd animal       if its a simulator why can t they simulate animal grazing rotation    bottom line be   giant have more time to put out a well product and they didn t   they simply don t care about we as consumer because they know people will buy their junk because its   new   and then the modder will come and make the game what it should be    iv e be play since fs    and this be the life cycle of this company    I refuse to hand they      for the work they do   I refuse to see they profit off of dedicated modder who just want a well game for themselves and other    giant   you suck     update      hour in   I get back on for oxygen david calmsden farm map   he s an amazing modder and calmsden farm will not be release on       during that time I have notice minor improvement with the game that be nice but still aren t worth the      price tag   those improvement be   sleep time ask when you want to wake up   not how many hour you want to sleep   the field work animation look much well than      grain ect be till a flat texture when pile up or in a cart   so that s an equal draw   the graphic be slightly well than     and the overall ambiance be well   this obviously can vary from map to map    those minor improvement aside   I would say maybe pick it up on a deep discount sale   the bad part about it be the modder have mostly move to fs    so you re almost force to follow they for new content      update       hour in   literally the only reason I play this game be for the mod   I ve never play the map make by giant   you drop into they and you instantly want to puke its so bad   unrealistic   one day when I become a billionaire I m not go to solve world hunger or cure cancer   I m go to buy this company   fire everyone and hire all the modder and let they loose so it can finally become the sim that it want to be
I keep think if I want to buy this game or not   afraid it would be boring and be the same thing over and over   I be so wrong   I m happy I purchase the       version   the mod be great and add to the fun   you can adjust the game to be as real as you would like   or simply tune it down to be more of a gaming experience   you may ask   gaming experience    you can set a month to be the normal full length or tune it down to a month pass in a single in game day   you can also play in real time   or speed up the time to     x   press      to slow time or press     multiple time to speed up time    the most important mod I instal be the gps mod   it help you plow or plant perfectly straight row   I would highly recommend the game to those who enjoy simulator or farm game   lot of video on youtube to help you out   check out tutorial by a youtuber name   farmer cop    I have no affiliation      I only mention he because it teach I what to do at first   what I do and didn t need and how to modify money if need   I m sure there be other   but you will love this game   have fun and farm away
awesome game but none to play with
the farm be farm
I have play farming simulator since        n ps    I love it from the day I start play it   watch how the game mechanic have change over the year   be amazing   the mod over the year as well
my acquaintance have talk alot about this game   I hadn t play a farming simulator since early       s but this game have bring I back in to the series   would recommend
the good thing to come out of germany since the automobile   as a farming enthusiast and farm worker I find it amazingly detailed and captivating but at the same time not too stressful so that anyone who like a relax gaming experience can have fun with it   you will learn what its like to tend to delicious grape   take care of fluffy sheep or plough field for day on end   in the year of it be release the devs and modding community have take the already good farming experience and turn it into something amazing
my dream be to become a farmer   I play this game in first person   because when I do that   I feel like I really be a farmer   the realistic farming of this game unnatural and awesome   this game may be the reason I become a farmer   enjoy
so easy to lose a few hour or day if your into it enough can be a pain and difficult to use some of the forestry machinery but a challenge be good with load of free mod you really can make what you want and start from where you want and make it as easy or difficult to suit you   love this game
love this game   get it a week ago and I can not stop play   I m go to need rehab after this game      thing I dislike   the achievement on steam   I get they   but I can not for the life of I figure out what the heck they mean and what I need to do to get more   some weird little bug here and there but nothing game break   o   and the ai farmhand need work   there as dumb as my cat   and that s say something   overall       just for the addict part   but it can grow more   and beter
fs    be the great game for relaxed and competitive farming   I ve play for      hour and have enjoy every second of it   if you want an ultra realistic and down right amazing farming experience   this be the game for you
I m go to be late for work tomorrow thank to this game    that be if I show up at all   
if you re crash at         all of a sudden   do you update to the late nvidia driver   yes   I too    rollback or reinstall an old version and you will be good
I eat a watermelon whole
update   okay have quite a few more hour in and   I just can t recommend this game without two critical mod from f    be available for f     which I know one of they be be work on    ai be horrible   I have to manually do most thing for the ai   same issue in fs    be in f     go to be the only reliable new feature   load and deliver you re lucky if you get it to work   most of the time you have to load the trailer yourself then it will go deliver but then it get lose on go to load again and just stay there not know how to go fill again    even more bug be show their head as I have play more   like palette getting stick in the ground and have to ram they over and over to try to free they or edit a file   this have cause I much headache   also   there have be no patch at all try to fix the issue that be show up more and more                                                                 so   I ve play this game for about    hour to make sure I understand the entire working the good I could   summary be   wait till the mod community fix what this should have be   I wish there be a middle ground between yes and no as I don t think its a hard no but definitely not a yes yet    I have almost       hour on f    and love it   it have its issue that fs    I be hope to solve   and for some of the issue f    succeed at    graphic   yep much much well and have have zero issue   I run it with fidelityfx on it s set for quality not performance and it look amazing   I have have no stutter etc   I m not really worried about fps with the base map   I m sure down the road that will be something I ll look into    ai helper    oh I sooo be hope this would eliminate the need for the two mod that make fs    sooo much well   but alas no   ai be still the basic it be in f     plus some shiney add to it to hide the fact they will still ram a fence and waste all your product as they spin tire think they can still go forward or just ram into each other and scratch their head   two different field    it be well then the default fs    though   you can at least loop they to sell your stuff   once you understand how the helper menu work that be   you still can t have the ai unload a combine      don t get I start on try to have they drive to a field and hope you set your waypoint far enough into the field where you don t get   field not find   message when your tractor be on the field   oh   and plow    yeah have fun with that if the plow rotate side   their driving on the main road I ve never have an issue with   big plus there   ai traffic will even stop for they   I m hope the modding community will bring to fs    the two epic helper program   once those be add will be a big improvement    production    yay   I don t have to use a mod anymore   boo    you have to buy the building and when you start no way you can afford from scratch to buy all the production building   great feature that I look forward to utilize more   though I do do some rough math and be wonder if some of they be really more profitable   I would like to have have they add the production chain picture they post into the game though   would help greatly someone new to the game know what production can do and need without have to buy each place    base map    well they be base map   play which one you like until more be add by the community   they be beautiful map   very well do   even if you feel like you re in the middle of town on the us map with super tiny field        for those that say there isn t as much stuff as fs     well of course there isn t   it s a brand new game   be patient    as for the pay we for black beauty or the mac skin    yeah don t like that one bit   those should be free if you have a season pass at the very least   way to try to money grab with micro transaction hide as something else    summary    beautiful game and will be amazing once bug be work out and the modding community get a hold of it   once that happens buy it   for now   up to you but I would say wait
pretty good game   only recommend if the game be on sale not really worth    
   star   this game be addict      love it   it be really relax to play   a great stress reliever
I come home from the farm every day to farm more   god I love corn   without thuis game I wqould not be able to far     hour out of my day   bck in the dya s thofkd the mjountain gkihng  
farming will grow on you
after play a couple of hour   and look at absolute bull   t throughout    year of this game existence   I decide it s time to finally speak up   and share my impression on steam    what be this game in general   huge concert of incompetence   bad decision   and corpo bull   t with machinery brand in the main role    be this game enjoyable   if you be agriculture enthusiast   yes   unfrotunately   it s the good game of this genre you can get    be there way to make this game even well   yes   there be a lot of mod from community who make and make much well work than developer themselves do   ps   no   I m not hate without a reason here   for example compare season mod from fs    and f     to original feature in f      game lack of really basic function which some of they be already make by people already even back in         what kind of function be I talk about    manual machinery attach   wrap twine for baler   photo mode   they win t add simple hand tool   so we be force to do      of even the most simple stuff with heavy machinery    etc   there be really more of this kind of stuff   and no it s some of it be not even hard or limit by engine to implement into the game    there be also a lot of technical and visual bug   and in the recent major update they even make a decision to remove a pretty common and important visual effect from the wheel   despite most of the game if not every single game focus on drive vehicle have it   because they decide it look well in their opinion    forum thread   they be so focused on promote brand   they be mostly put modern machinery into the game to make some kind of   advertisement   of it   game could really use a much much more of retro vintage machinery   but it seem we have to embrace only the big and the new machinery    modhub   place full of wonder   they be send back the good mod because of tiny irevellant bug or number in the code   while other be instantly accept despite they be for example make on a knee and few of they can totally corrupt the savegame   not mention how they be recently treat one of the modder who be falsely accuse of steal asset from the other one    not so long ago they also publish a new dlc make by some group from the outside of their studio   dlc be simply unfinished and buggy and yet it get release    additionaly   they also tend to remove comment from their video comment section on yt if they be say negative thing about the game             why be I write a negative review despite play this game all the time   because people work on this game be make quite unacceptable or incompetent change and addition to this game   which be not rarely even straight up sign of disrespect towards it s player base   and also because most likely new title of this series win t have any decent improvement and qol change for both kind of player play this game   arcade and realism enjoyer     giant software   you could really use a decent competitor in the farming game market
really relax game to play when you don t want something too engaging   just put on some music and make your dream farm   mod be a must for the game   expand it   new good to manufacture   warehouse to build and decorate   forestry stuff   be weird like I and build a restaurant with a tractor museum next to it with load of old tractor   the game be great fun with friend   doesn t matter if you do a serious roleplay   or mess about   definitely worth the money and it s one of not many game that offer full crossplay   meaning if you be on pc and have friend on xbox and playstation    you can all play together   no problem at all and you even get crossplay mod and lot of they
farming simulator     be one of the most relaxing   addictive game I have ever play   they have a wonderful community of modder   content creator   and in general friendly helpful individual
yes great game
very good game
cow go moo   pig go oink    sheep go baaa     horse go nay      tractor go fly       wait what

  local disk   c      user      your user name       document       my game         farmingsimulator             mod   the path to glory
grow stuff   get the stuff   sell the stuff   tractor go brrrrrrrr         will consume your life
I wish I could give his a meh set   it s good   don t get I wrong   but completely ruin by the         physics   you will learn to despise lamp post and road sign as you will be getting stick on they a lot   bump in the road of field   you ll get stick on those too   don t get I start on carry pallet around    it s good   it s the good farming game money can buy right now   it s just so deeply   deeply flawed   you d expect a developer who have churn these game out for year to have learn how to make thing collide realistically
how to cheat game buyer and earn more money       release one of the most expensive indie game on steam      add a year    season pass that give you access to all dlc release in the first year      release dlc that be not include in the year    season pass    p s   yes   I know about another studio   but this be official dlc   it be publish in the dlc list on steam and in the game   it be publish by the publisher of the game   studio developer   this be a formality   p p s   typical you have to read the fine print situation   p p p s   giant software   thank for make I feel like a loser who s be cheat
if you have fs     don t waste your time   if you do not then this be a reasonable starting point   the only real gain between fs     and fs     be the ability to assign your worker to haul load    which most map mod don t support   there be a couple more type of product you can grow and of course you can purchase and operate element of the production chain   but nothing earth shatter
the game be good   the company however be not   I be look forward to buy a few of the yearly expansion and such during the autumn sale   but no   you be only allow to get any kinda discount if you don t own the game   or haven t own in the past   I do try to delete the game from my steam account only for it to not work anyway    as a exist customer of the original f    I have to pay       more than if I just create a new steam account and buy the main game plus the yearly pass    to I it just seem like they be just try to milk their exiting customer   very anti consumer and I m disappointed in a company whose game I ve like
    hour in   I can now give my opinion of farming simulator      I will try to be brief   don t buy   a dev tell I about a month ago that the inclusion of   season    a fs     mod   could be turn off   he didn t tell I that I would have to go into the new   month   length and set it to one day and then sleep until six month have pass to see my crop ready to harvest   thank bud    I never think I would be say this   having buy fs                but I be sad I buy this game   now all I can do be hope the devs give folk like I an option to correct this   or hope some modder do it    don t get I start about how my raggedy pickup truck drive like dale earnhardt at daytona   I be pretty sure I could win an indy car race with my tractor   I know my opinion will be unpopular   but since I be old I really don t care   get off my lawn    I win t be buy any more farming simulator game until well after their release   if ever   so I can see what the people be say about it
yes
I have never be more interested in just how the grass grow
play an hour or two
I really do not want to give this a thumb down but the negative out weight the positive   don t get I wrong   if you be a simulation player and love agriculture and machine this game be awesome   but I see a call of duty issue of copy paste gaming with maybe a few new feature   it feel like you need mod to make the game fresh and have good variety   variety as in old equipment and realistically obtainable equipment     I ve play fs    and     and they be fun   I didn t ever play     but when fs    come out I have extreme hope of awesome thing they would have do to the game   but it feel like a copy paste   fs s physics engine be the same from     and you feel like you be drive a static block with a hitbox and vehicle do not seem to have weight like real equipment   log truck feel like a cylinder when load instead of have actual weight   tractor that take turn flip like an upright book but after tip they just kinda magnetize themselves back on all    wheel   bump in the terrain do not make you feel like you be on real ground but rather on a grid with random bump   gathering   place   plowing   and edit all be still do on a gridlike platform instead of a more sophisticated and realistic pattern   tire and plow do not leave rut and drive over crop doesn t do much other than create a   delete your product   line from where your track be   not ask for any beamng destruction   but there be absolutely no damage modeling in the game other from how long you use the equipment make wreckless drive very forgiving   vehicle sound be extremely basic   shift gear on manual vehicle seem very automatic and brake stopping feel like a over exaggerated ab system    this sound like a game karen complaint but holy hell   the series be over     year old go into       and game from       be excel in physics   gta   a revolutionary game    take idea from mudrunner snowrunner   spintire have be out since       and leave ground deformation and tire mud trail even after shut off the game and load back in    I m sad to say that even though farming sim be satisfy to grow crop   earn money   make your own field   and understand some interesting stuff about farm   its just not cut it anymore   for a game that sell at a triple a price and a large fan base   it do not seem the developer care enough to make an overhual or remaster change to the game and if       be go to be the same way   I m sorry   I will not be get it  
great farming game
fantastic game   over     h so far with my gf and love every second of it
definitely an amazing game I ve play farming simulator since       with my dad   I will always love this game series I just need friend to play with get boring playing alone all the time   I have learn a lot about farming by play these game for so long and understand thing and thing I don t understand be animal I don t know how to feed they or anything about they   I highly recommend this game to anyone
farming simulator      I m obsess with this game   I ve be play all the game since fs     and this by far the good of they all   the graphic be stunning   if your computer can handle the max graphic setting   and the gameplay be extremely addictive and immersive   the attention to detail be so good you get lose just think about it    big improvement    addition        before I get yell at   these be thing I could be well   I m not criticise giant in any way        this be easily the good instalment in the series and I highly recommend it if you re think about buy it   I ve only play about     hour at the time of review   but I m sure I m go to have many thousand of hour on fs      if I have to score the game out of      I d give it a solid     as long as your computer can run it at decent graphic at a high framerate   it s amazing   I also recommend use a wheel as it add to the immersion of the game    I hope this review help you with your decision
I would recommend this game to anyone who like big machine   farming life and nature   great recommendation

in this farming simulator     we have a lot of improvement   which be the physics   the sound of the vehicle   the sound environment   the manual gearbox   the season with snow   the rendering of the map which be really more detailed   this which make the immersive side excellent
this be the good farming simulator yet    significant performance improvement compare to f    when run high end view distance    farming simulator isn t for everyone   my kid have nearly zero interest in it   although they like game like minecraft and scrap mechanic   it s a builder game that s base on farming and or log and or trucking   if you don t like machine   its probably not for you   there be a lot of freedom with how you play and a crazy amount of mod from the passionate community   I usually put a fair bit of time into the grain aspect of it   and expand or join field   I like to play at scale which require courseplay and autodrive mod in order to make that feasible   lot of youtube content to check out
I have play every farming simulator and so far this f     be good but it should have bring over some of the stuff from f     like the grass dry to hay and the one thing I don t like about it so far be the auto drive becuase it always tell I it can not find location or be unreachable but overall I have put in      hour into this game and I be ahave a blast
do it
way to many bug for a full price release
over the past couple year   I ve rack up a lot of hour in this game   and while I don t regret a single one of they I unfortunately can not recommend this product still   fs    be   sadly   simply f    with a fresh coat of paint and a bunch of feature shove in that highlight just how backwards the development of this franchise it   but   that be the end result of become the number one farming simulation game and have investor to appease   I suppose   regardless   the crack be start to show   whether through the ai   the physics   or the dlcs    for the first point   there be additional ai feature in fs     but they be unreliable to the point I don t use they   the traditional ai that fail to plow a square field be still there   but now you can unleash they on the world at large   deliberately   with the new routing mechanic   that say   even though they have a new feature   they still work the same under the hood mean a complete lack of actual pathfinding or collision detection   so   more often than not   they end up stuck   give up   or both   just like in the previous installment    the physics too continue to be a gripe of mine   production   even in the base game   be all but require to profit as they generally increase profit by double or more   but also introduce an ungodly number of pallet if do improperly   you can work around this by set production to either teleport your good between themselves   or immediately sell   either way make the production practically no different to a normal sell point   but pallet handling be a core part of the gameplay loop   yet I continue to both experience myself and observe pallet either have no friction whatsoever   or fly after the pallet fork as you drive away   the physics engine continue to be a problem as dlcs like silverrun forest be release   which show off just how broken the log handling physic be as well    this segue nicely into my final gripe   which be more about the approach to dlcs in general   there be   of course   the obligatory mention of the pump and hose dlc not be include in either season pass   but that be not actually an outlier as there be also a few       dlcs that add one or two tool that be also not include   but in general   the dlcs tend to have a lack of meaningful content   pump n   hose include   either hamfiste thing into the old system in the case of zielonka s ridger   or the base game grass mulcher   simply apply a layer of fertiliser instead of have unique mechanical benefit   or paywalle random unrelated feature in the case of the kubota dlcs passenger system   the model in the dlcs also tend to be less feature rich than some mod   and I don t think that be an unfair comparison as mod fundamentally be the same type of content most of the dlcs provide   on their own   the dlcs be fine but they show a lack of integration   instead each dlc exist in its own silo as if mean to be use on its own rather than part of a great farming simulator whole    overall   then   while farming simulator     be a game I enjoy   it be not one I can recommend as a product of the capitalist challenge every successful franchise must face   many new feature and content pack have be provide to we over the past two year   provide a very different base game experience to fs     but the core gameplay loop hasn t change   the engine and it take two year to get meaningfully different crop   if I didn t play multiplayer   I wouldn t have see a reason to change   if you be look to get into the fs franchise      be just as competitive of a farming simulator as     unless you really like watch the broken physics struggle or want to try something fs    specific   like the pump n   hose dlc   but by the same margin   you may want to wait   as in lieu of a year    season pass we may hear more about the next pc entry in the come future   and see the direction this franchise have take   it will only be more expensive and monetize than this one
more realistic than any other game I have play
chicken
I m very disappointed   one of the main thing I be hope for and expect be improve ai worker   when I hear they have overhaul the ai worker and make improvement and add new functionality I be very excited   after play for an hour   it be abundantly clear than next to nothing have change   worker still be incapable of work any field that be not       square or rectangular still get stuck on object constantly and have no ability to avoid traffic   honestly this feel like the same system in fs       edit   so after look at some of the issue the ai be have it be very possible that there be some bug that be affect the overall ai effectiveness   but in general this be not the big improvement that the devs where hype it up to be
great game to play with friend
farm good
great game but pricey   especially if you want all the dlcs
giants pls   you use the same game engine over many many year now   how can you not be able to fix your server   its nearly not possible to play on a server   what be your engineer do    you do not even seem to try to fix they actually   the game be really nice   but      for a game where there be like no testing or qa before   and the mp do not even work   sell it for      or fix your server and bug then do       shame really
giants   what the hell have you be work on since fs    release   there be good thing but I want to highlight first the fail of this game development    ai   it get bad and bad by the game   I honestly would rather run the ai from f    than the ai in this game   instead of perfect it they have add extra feature that don t even work   so many time the ai can not tell which side its mean to work on and instead   for example cultivate what s already cultivate   vanilla tractor   implement and map    the autonomous drive work half the time and that s when the ai be not swerve left and right because it do not know how to drive straight     and when it do drive straight it can not take corner   these feature should of be like courseplay where the player record the route   do not even get I start follow I still not a thing in the game and    month after release still no mod    graphic    we re get there   but still quite behind with modern day   I can not believe that a title of this scale   hype that they re add parallax occlusion to make ground texture appear more   d      in          embarrass   lack big dynamic in area such as the spread from behind the combine   texture on   texture off   honestly if the engine be the bottleneck scrap it please and go with something more high end and introduce more dynamic ground effect off of implement   tyre   environment etc     economy    it doesn t make sense   but it work   yes the different level of difficulty have their challenge respectfully however I ve find it be always the same vendor that offer the good price and the only place that have   great demand   be the crusher make the game very stale    haut beyleron      bug on sugar beet harvester where they down unload   I ve report it   I ve see other complain on reddit     month later no fix   generally speak very low frequency of update   not hotfix parche no nothing         positive     I be not expect that many new addition to the store   its very nice to have new model and new brand   however I would rather have less of this and well development    the new industry structure be nice   I sacrifice a good sized field for it quite enjoyable however not as rewarding as it should be imo    use vehicle   what a game changer    one of the good thing that have happen to the franchise     orchard be ok   decent all round structure   however again consider how much of time you need to put in it the reward isn t worth it     at all   purely for pleasure   if you re new get farm sim      save your self some buck and enjoy a   balanced   game   otherwise for base game fs    I d say they price be still right   just prepare for bethesda       ai behaviour
this be the good game I ever buy it give you infinite hour of fun with mod and more       
tractor go wrom wrom
I like farm
good game
turn on some tune   and power up the deere and plow your way thru the day    all from the comfort of your gaming chair
tractor blyat
it s like farm sim     but new       
difference between each major fs version be very little   in fact   f    be the most inconsistent version of f you can get   let I explain   the model   vehicle   pallet   etc    resolution absolutely mismatch resolution of world ground plane   different substrate   mud   dirt   gravel    to I this gameplay feel like have gta v car drive in minecraft world     vehicle have unrealistic grip to ground   inertia   substrate be ignore      when fertilise   harvesting   plough   you name it   texture change be bad than in minecraft   between biome      pallet   production chain   oh dear   well would not have release they at all   have you try load pallet on a trailer   spinning   shake   fly   and throw other stuff around   unpleasant experience for sure     light and illumination quality have a long way to go   light pole illuminate very little area   no light across game have volumetric   very unrealistic     landscaping allow smooth slope only if do at right angle   high quality tractor be literally jump when cross slope that be not make in alignment to world       game have very nice sound   they be way deep than in any of fs version   but yet   they don t match the tachometer   when start engine   sound especially be asynchronous to revs   to conclude   I believe model in fs    be very decent already   instead of spend resource on what simply work in the game   like vehicle appearance    why not to improve area which really be scream for change   over more than a decade of continuous development   the real area call for improvement have be leave alone   production chain pallet system be the final call for I   I really don t think this game be worth buy   save your coin   don t waste it on this parody   instead stick to fs     maybe f    and hopefully one day we will get the quality of what other title   other game   have achieve today
always wonder if the franchise would entertain I or not   finally break down and pick it up    slow start figure thing out   but it get well fast due to the contract system and ai helper   if it wasn t for those I d have quit in the first     hrs out of boredom   I now realise that the game be mean to be slow   mean to be enjoy with a beverage   the second    hrs be   much   more enjoyable    very stable game   decent graphic   ai car be as dangerous as I be on the road
after play this game for over      hour   I rarely every put that much time into a game on pc    I can honestly say that fs    be a step in the right direction for the series   the tractor be very well detailed   the sound be much well than      and the texture   light   and environment feel much nice   the two new map be gorgeously detailed   and feel at least a bit more realistic for the part of the world they re in    as for the bug   glitch   and other issue the game have   I can honestly say I appreciate how much work giant do to fix these issue   the modding community be very active   bring a lot more content to the game   despite a near perfect record of positive addition   I still feel like there be many issue with the game   production chain feel rush   pallet don t handle nearly as good as they should   especially with how often you handle they    and the new vineyard feel bland and tedious   helper can t do vine work   despite the feature be there    I feel like a bit more work in these area would be a great step forward for the series   but I m just a virtual farmer   so what do I know about game design    tldr   fs    be a huge step forward in the series   but still have its problem   I d highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in agriculture   due to the amount of depth it have
great game   I be hesitant buy this when I enjoy     so much and some review say it be not much of an update but they be wrong   the construction interface be so much well now and there be way more stock customization in the vehicle   the add gameplay mechanic of stone picking and production line add much more realism and if you want even more   download the free dlc for precision farming as well   the ai helper on the field be pretty good and you now have limit build in autodrive feature though those definitely need some help so I d still recommend download courseplay and autodrive for the full automation experience
still the king   I have be play the fs game since fs       I own all of they for pc now either here on steam or gamersgate   I ve modde   I ve map   I ve stream   and post youtube video for this game over the year   admittedly I kind of lose interest after fs    because it seem   at the time   that giants wasn t add very much content between release outside of just the new machine lineup   the machine lineup be impressive but I want more   oh sure they add a couple of new crop   add forestry   the music player   etc   etc   but it just didn t seem like it be enough in some way   there be so much waste potential    so I wait on this one for a while   I m now sorry that I do because the amount of addition to this version   compare to past release   be really impressive to say the least    buy it   you win t be disappoint
warn   fanboy   and proud of it   review ahead    this be the   th version of farming simulator I have play   it s pretty safe to say that I be a fan of it   there be no doubt   I will start by say that this be literally the same game as fs     as it be   fs           a common complaint from some people for reason that I do not understand   what make our favorite game   our favorite game   if they turn it into a tractor demolision derby   would it be the same game we love now   while that do sound fun   it be not what we all originally buy the game for   we buy   and then rebuy   these game because there be something about they that we like   why have the gta franchise be so wildly popular all of these year   for the reason I point out above   standard psychology aside      after almost     hour in game   I will say that fs ls    be essentially as it always have be   and I personally like that   it s familiar   the game play be easy to fall into and the mechanic be essentially on the same page   this be something I personally look for when buy a continuation of a title   if I have to relearn the entire control and play sequence every time a new version come out   I be eventually go to leave it for something else   this actually play a hand in what turn out to be my dislike for   professional farmer   cattle and crop    the process between the two be so drastic that I determine that I do not have the time to become immerse in cnc   with all the other thing go on in my life    the game have tremendous potential though   I be pray for it s success    other game   guitar   synthesizer and autistic sister do not afford I that luxury   so be able to skip the tutorial mode and actually get right to play on a basic level with just my xbox style controller be a huge a   for I   my g    and saitek panel will follow   but for now   I m just chug along old skool    this release do offer some significant change that be worth invest in if you be an fs    or     player interested in continue your farming streak   it do incorporate a new season algorithm comparable to the season mod that have be popular for many year   I don t use it because time do not allow I crop rotation or choose localize profile   so I will let other speak more on that   you can turn season off   but keep the seasonal rotation go   so the month   and the leave on the tree etc    change and it snow during the winter   you may want to plow that   and you can    but you can still farm arcade style and not miss some of the pretty detail in these update without extra time require to play more realistically    you can even lock the game to a particular season month and just play static weather if you want   of course   all of the standard setting be there   weed   plowing requirement   crop destruction worker buy supply and so on    so graphic     yeah   I believe they be improve in the way that one would be able to improve on something that have be work for you for year   I have hear complaint   but I haven t experience any real issue while say that the graphic have advance well   display all the mirror   have light on and my beacon work way well on f    on my now old I       f gtx      I that I use on f     where it stutter under heavy load and could only display    mirror at a time   that have to be   by any logic   well   your experience may vary   or maybe your rig be crap   clinical observation    fs    introduce   production    having learn from the modding community   that we like to do more than just grow wheat and deliver it to sale   mean a lot to we   so they have introduce bakery and woodworke shop   and a few other production that you may simply grow and ship to   or purchase and make part of your operation   with this have come some add crop   sorghum   grape and olive specifically   this be cool and fun thus far in the base game   and I can t wait to see what modder do with these new opportunity    serious complaint note here   the map that come with the game do not allow very much space for build in these new tool and severely limit how much you can expand your empire   we need some big a    map with a lot of buyable land from the modding community   and I say that with much love   as we have some serious map artist out there    look your way stevie   dajnet and papa smurf    my    favorite map maker out there   I m sure that there be other fan who will be in touch with their people   there be already a couple of interesting edit of elmcreek that give a little more space   thank xul    I could go on   but I suggest you check it out for yourself   please keep in mind that there be some bug that need to be work out   as always with a new release of fs ls and some patience be require for the most rewarding experience   if you be wonder about upgrade   it be an upgrade   so I would recommend it    happy farming     these be solely my view   I have not be ask or reward by giant software in any way for this review   not even sure they would like it  
haha tractor go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
the last f that I play be     and while its still the same formula they really have improve a lot
I can t even load a          map past      anymore   what the       be you people do to this game       
   I realize now   after someone else be kind enough to buy I farm sim     on release   that giants software do not put much effort into their product   there be innumerable bug that be blatantly obvious to anyone who play the game for     minute   various graphical glitch like with the rostelmash starter combine where the grain create this unsightly cone that shoot off towards space while unload   or tree smudge   certain combination harrow seeder do not till the soil while the seeder be attach   despite that be the entire purpose of the combination and be state in the menu that be what they do   worker wage rival that of the hourly income of jeff bezos   the only real upside to the base game be that it be a bit pretty   and the map be a lot large with far more farm ground    in the end the only thing that make giant software s game playable be the modding community   you would be hard pressed to find a well community of devs than in the farm sim community   they be what press this piece of coal into a diamond   wait for a steam sale of at least      and until the modder have fix this game to purchase   and if anyone at giant read this   next time send out some free copy to your good mod devs and fix the glare bug before release    edit   once the modder do their magic I will likely be recommend this game   but as for now I can not give it a thumb up

well   well   well   where to begin with farming simulator      this game have be a wild ride right from the off   let I tell you   for          it s worth every penny    or cent    for the hour of entertainment   bewilderment   and outright hilarity it offer    first up   the graphic   ah   the beautiful   crisp   breathtake graphic   I ve be around the digital block a few time and I can tell you   I ve never see corn sway in the breeze quite like it do in f     with scenery score an easy         the map be so realistic   you can practically smell the fresh country air and feel the chill of the winter snow   elmcreek   haut beyleron   and erlengrat    each one a picturesque jewel in the farming crown    now   onto the machine    the heart and soul of any farming enterprise   they start off gleam   pristine   and before you know it   they re cake in dirt   just like the real deal   rain   snow   all that beautiful stuff   they ve think of everything   the animation be something to behold    watch a crop sparayer folding and unfolding be an oddly satisfying way to spend an afternoon    beware of set an unfortunate username   the game s character editor seem to develop an unhealthy attachment to your first choice   force you to change it every time you log in   I m seriously consider make   usernameregret   my permanent moniker    and let s talk about the dlcs   yes   some be fantastic    the g weil pack and platinum expansion   absolute steal at        and         respectively   and who can resist the charm of the zetor     k for a mere         but the other   well   let s just say it feel more like a   donation   to the developer than a value add to the game    however   not all be bountiful in the field of farming simulator      I ve get some beef with the size of the map   I mean   if I m in a pickup truck   it shouldn t take I just     minute to get from one end to the other while respect speed limit   this isn t a sunday drive   it s farming    and then there be the ai worker   oh what a joy they be   you d think they be drive a ferrari across monte carlo the way they charge for their service   picture this   you task they with the simple job of haul sugar beet from one end of our admittedly small map to the other   they putter along at the blister speed of a sloth on vacation   somewhere between     and     mph   and for this high octane thrill ride   they blee you dry   that s right   they liberate       of your hard earn in game currency for every     in game minute they spend at the wheel   at this rate   they d drive any player into bankruptcy fast than you can say   farming simulator        and would it kill they to animate a door open   we ve master teleportation in fs      a feat yet unachieve in the real world   mind you    because you simply phase into your tractor s cab   meanwhile   community modder have do what seem impossible for the devs   make walk around interior a reality    and then   there s the infamous   black sky bug    picture this   after two or three wonderful farming session   the once clear blue sky turn pitch black    both day and night   it s like you ve be suddenly transport to a parallel universe where physics doesn t exist   and neither do the wheel of your vehicle   you ll find yourself operate a fleet of float machinery   the train   they pull a houdini on you   even the hard work farmer can t load an invisible train    now   the process to fix this would make a nasa engineer break into a cold sweat   first   you must perform a ritual of delete save file   then exorcise your system of the game and its dlcs   after a couple of computer restart sprinkle in for good measure   you have to cleanse your computer s cache   once all this be do   it s time to download everything again like you re live your very own groundhog day   seriously   do I sign up to be a farmer or an it technician    last but not least   a shout out to the game s support team for their unresponsiveness   I report this black sky   vehicle tire disappear bug back in september        it s july       now   and I m still wait   hey   at least it s comfort to know that the simulated farming world be just as full of delay and ignore message as the real one    all in all   farming simulator     be a worthwhile venture for both seasoned and novice virtual farmer   offer hour of unique   engaging gameplay that will keep you hook   despite its occasional hiccup                and of course   when I decide to give it another whirl   the devs have zap away the windowedfullscreen option   marvelous   so now my option be squint at a window the size of a postage stamp   or go full screen and play digital whack a mole with my window every time I dare to multitask   it s like choose between a flat tire and run out of gas    either way   you re not go anywhere fast   let s just say   it add a whole new level of   challenge   to the game    one I never sign up for    and then   as if by some dark magic   full screen mode turn my in game camera into a carnival ride   swinge it to the right summon a ghostly cursor   which I be pretty sure be a myth   to play pinball on the screen edge   effectively put my camera move on timeout   as if that wasn t enough of a throwback   my fancy legion lenovo   I have decide to cosplay as a vintage computer   stuttering like it s try to communicate via morse code and ditch anti aliasing like a bad habit   meanwhile   my once crisp   k visual have devolve into a nostalgic pixel art exhibit   ah   the   good   old day    also   the game s support team still have not respond
just make an invite button
you tell they I like farming    cooper
at first I do not like it but once you start get good equipment get some fun mod its really fun and addict the only complaint be the fact it keep I up all night because I m addicted
well well well    play farming simulator     may only take up      of my day but it account for      of my happiness   x      life without the farm be no life   if farm sim     have    million fan   I be one of they   if farm sim     have      fan   I be one of they   if farming sim     have    fan   it be I   if farming sim     have   I be dead    master keep I work but I be thankful          would farm again
my first farming simulator and I have to say   it s alot of fun    I grow up in a city and never have any connection with farming   but since I leave the grey   lifeless city and move to a little town   I really appreciate the beauty in nature   animal and farming
devs be out of touch with the community you get ban from speak the truth about the game   p s   devs you ban I for speak truth about the bug all you have do since day one of release be ban people and rob they of the mod we make   ban I for life I don t care any long be play fs since fs    I m do with your crap game all you do cheat rob and steal from your community just look at the last dlc you create all mod idea that can be download but no let make it be own laughable rolling on the floor split my side     
enjoy farming simulator     so far   the game be a good step up from the previous version   the addition of production chain really expand the possibility of what you can do to earn that all important cash to expand your farm and invest in big and well machinery from the extensive in game catalogue   relax gameplay at its fine   and even well when play with friend
great game that improve on the last   I m very happy they have support mod instead of try to subdue they   the driving feel well on a controller but other control be well on keyboard so it s kind of a compromise but pretty much a      
it s great to see an overall improvement compare to farming simulator      but it s early day   still wait to see what modification be like for this game   and they have remove a lot of my favourite machinery from the game
game be pretty addictive   I can t speak for those who have play farming sim before this entry   but be new to the series   I be impressed with all the content   I put     hour into the game   fairly quickly   I feel like I only scratch the surface   well worth the money    ps   I be on a farm once   I know nothing about farming and I still really enjoy the game
very relak ven potato harvest
when I play the game it make time pass very fast   enjoy it
very good game   plenty to do with friend   total recommendation
I only play previous fs game a little but when I hear that they be add industry into fs I be very excited for the game   however the more I play the more disappointed I be    so this game support multiplayer but if you want to host dedicated server you have to buy copy of game   so the person who be host have to buy game and all the dlcs twice   once for the server and once for his game machine   that be very unfriendly move from giant   if you don t want to pay twice you can rent server      which giant no doubt take cut from       multiplayer itself be lack many feature that I would expect from such game   for example trading between player be not support at all   production building need many different resource but player can t help each other out with they      not very good multiplayer game isn t it   you can build production and sell point building   but other player can t interact with they   they even show in the price comparison list but it be meaningless because no one can sell there   for example you build a spinnery and that will show up as new sellpoint for wool and cotton but you can t sell there because you be just add stuff to storage for processing and other player can t sell there because they can t interact with your building       so why do it list as sell point        very disappointing   another disappointment be the implementation of production chain   they add only a little value to your good but they add massive workload for you   production chain produce hundred of pallet that have to be store   load on trailer and sell at high price point and you have to do that manually   so you will spend ton of time on forklift just move the pallet and load they on trailer and the more production building you have the bad it get    and then there be bug   there be so many bug in this game   physics bug where bale and vehicle can be send fly for hundred of meter   physics bug where your truck go thru curve can suddenly snap into sharp angle go in opposite direction   desync bug where game will load original shape of map instead of the one you be actually play on so then you can see vineyard go thru air   you can have your under the surface and so on   tree cutting be one big exercise in frustration   I have tree disappare on I after I cut few branch   the tree be still there on ground tho   block way and stuff but I coudn t see it      after server restart the tree be stand on it s original spot like nothing happen   there be way too many bug       and last straw for I be the recent update       they stealthily impose limit on number of pallet and bale ingame to       in our game we probably have over thousand of bale and pallet around and even if we sell most of they it would still severely limit what player can actually do   so the update      literally make the game unplayable for I    the attitude giant take towards player be really regretable   I feel like they be impose ton of timesink on player   and milk they for theyr money   do I mention that production building have option to autosell good give you the option to avoid move a pallet   but it come with      low price for product so at that point you be well of just sell raw resource       what the hell be that option even there for       
awesome game with endless potential to do whatever you want   within reason    the constant release of mod that continue to make the game even well   farming simulator have be my go to game for many year
really fun game and pretty well make
its the good installment in the franchise to date   an absolute truck load of love and attention have be pour into all the little detail and feature within   a little rough around the edge   the odd glitch issue problem   etc etc   but nothing that will not be patch out within a few day and nothing game break   I can   unreservedly   recommend this game to anyone who enjoy the simulator as a whole   especially ets at   its get that nice relax gameplay element    of note   the game be much hard now   especially start out   no more own the entire map and all the tractor after just a few harvest   now everything feel like an investment   something you earn   and that s on normal    tldr   yes   its good   it scratch the sim itch   and I highly recommend it
fs     same as the one before it   be nothing but a money grab    they release a season pass   only to make micro update throughout the year   then release another season pass the following year    these season pass cost as much as the base game   its like buy the game over and over   every year   with nothing really improve or add to justify the insane scam go on here    furthermore   their dedicated server function be a joke   you need a complete   nd copy of the game   on another stream account   to run the dedicated server from   this mean buy the base game   and all the season pass   or individual dlcs   for    account   since someone that doesn t have dlc x y can t join a server that be run with dlc x y enable
feel good so far   some minor issue with graphic but I guess they ll probably get fix soon   I d recommend buy the game as it s a pretty solid entry in the franchise
you can farm in any way you want I myself be with the series since       with f    this be my   rd game so far   I think if you want to be a farmer   or what to see what it would like if you where a farmer then this be the game for you
traktor go vroom
another excellent game
I love this game I mean I have     hour at this time but I have       hour on console I think that can speak for itself
since release   I have spend some hour in the game    put a tl dr at the start   I have actually find it to be pleasant   however   in some place the experience can be a little disappointing as it feel a lot like its predecessor    f      go into some detail   there be a lot of positive aspect to the game   a revamp sound system definitely make the experience more enjoyable   however   there be much more to what I have to say besides this very simple change    what I enjoy     overall multiplayer experience be great fun   be able to run multiple farm and help each other out be something that I ve enjoy throughout the game series   fs    have not fail I and I still find it very enjoyable     everything be easy to master   once you give it a quick read     overall experience be not bad   however it be also not perfect   unfortunately   I be hope that as the game continue to be on the market   there will be a number of update that will improve the experience     what need work on     something that could make the gaming experience well   would be an improvement in physics   its nice to see move part in the machinery etc   however vehicle still do not feel like they be be drive across a muddy field when it be rain   for example   it all feel   stiff     if that be the right way to word it   there be no aspect of a challenge in that aspect    something that I be hope for   consider how long the franchise have be on the market     season add something without really add something   yes   through the addition of season   we experience the race against time to make sure that everything be do in a timely manner   however   yet again    I be expect a challenging environment during the winter   struggle to get around   snow physics on the ground etc   this be something that would definitely make this new aspect worthwhile   for now it just feel as if you be drive across a flat surface     map editing be a whole issue in itself to be fair   it take a lot of patience   we be give four basic tool that be pretty much useless   I have come against situation where I be unable to utilise the tool e g   lower raise the ground win t work   personally I think that it s something that need look at     base on pre release footage I be expect more from the ai   both worker and just ai on the road   there isn t much to be say about this   however the ai doesn t feel like ai     it s just there
the good game in existence
farm
daily crash on dedicated server where it doesn t matter what host you be use   it s the actual server software from giant that be at fault   there be also a bug that have be persist since december on server where it can t save your game   combine this with the daily crash you can expect   you will lose potential hour every day   where your progress be all dependent on backup you make   all this while we hear literary nothing from giant themselves     these common issue and bug be know on their own forum and there be no response from they   why   we   the player who have support these game for year   deserve well attention and insight   as much as I don t want to   I can not personally recommend this game to my friend   not in this current state   at this price   thank for read
there be a short and a long answer   if you already have f    with dlcs then you should stay away from this game or get it only when its on sale   at this time it have less to offer then what you have in f    for        if you be new to the fs then it will be cheapor for you on the long run to buy f     but try get it outside steam because you can get it cheap most of the time   but be warn   the game be more or less the same as f    with a little bit of inprove graphic   sound and game mechanic      ai    its dumb and annoying   ai traffic will ignore you and any traffic regulation   stop sign   right of way   speed sign   that a normal human being would expect the ai traffic to obey   they drive like every human player in gta   so be wary of they   the ai helper be not well   while the ai traffic drive with the speed of light   the ai helper will slow down to a crawl in corner and will come to a stop some time at intersection for no apparent reason   on the field if they have a implement that be wide then   m then they will not go until the field edge because they be afraid that they will get stick on a fence or tree   so instead they will ignore that      m of field completely      graphic   I will give this to giant   fs    be the most beautiful farming simulator that I see until now   but man they need to do something with the optimization because it can not be that with a rx      xt I need to spend    hour home the setting in on a    fps cap game that have a gtx      as recommend graphic card   I play on high setting with some setting turn down to get rid of the annoying stuttering   optimalise your game giant          gameplay    well its      f    in this regard with some new fs    mod that be integrate in to the game like      season   production line and a semi successful attempt of coursplay   what they do not manage to do be make it so that we the player could select how we want our field to be plow d   cultivate if we want to use a helper   I mean there be a mod in f    for that   could of be copy like the other tree   but be not so important it seam   in fact it feel like every aspect of the game be only half make and I would play an early access title with a      price tag   let I elaborate   so let take the not so new we take it from a fs    mod production line idea   I can now buy factory that make from something something   from wheat flour for instance    its a good idea    f    have a mod that do the same but now its integrate in game   be it well   well it would be   but its not finish   not finish you ask   why be that   well let I explain   so you can buy factory    all good    but    I would expect to know before I invest my money how much grain will the grain mill use up to make how much flour   I would like to see how much grain and what type will be use up in a period of time and how much flour will be make in that amount of time   but this info be only available to you if you buy the building   and if you buy the building then you can not sell it   you can not upgrade it   and this half way do attitude be all over the game   you can let your factory store   distribute   send the end product to the next factory that you own   or sell the product that it make   but there be a catch    you can not set a minimum price to sell   no time period to sell   the factory will sell in every hour whatever be in storage for the good price that be currently on the market minus      for that product   how do I know this   I test it over one hour long   because this crucial info be nowhere to be find in game   every step of the way you need to test   time and calculate for your self because there be not even the most basic information available to you   you would like to lease a tractor    go a head     how much will it cost I       you would like to know right   well       you   in short that s how it work   you lease a tractor   the lease price be nowhere to be see   how much it will cost you per day or hour be also miss   but hey if you press the lease button it will tell you at least how much be the initial lease price   good luck test the other two out   price fluctuation make no sense   the chart that should tell you wen be the time to sell will tell you august for a crop but the price will say       that and the high price will be in january just because   and don t even start with maintenance   you can now buy use equipment   another feature that I miss from fs    be finally in f    by the way so I m very happy   so you can buy equipment   implement   tractor   etc   that be in different state of decay   that you can repair   but the fact that these use equipment will deteriorate      fast then the new counterpart in the same usage scenario   and time span be nowhere to be see   the maintenance be so expensive that most of the time if you plow a field in hard mode you need to spend over      of your earning on repair for a     minute plow   most of the time the crop that I plant will not bring so much money in   helper cost     that s another area where giant         up   I mean I use the helper to plow a field   it take      for go    m on the the field         be you kid I     I would like to earn so much in my job   I know its a game but if I m play on hard mode and the crop that I just sell make I    k   how in hell can I afford to pay a helper to plow the field for     every second    the factory should make you more money and ad to the gameplay   but because you can not upgrade the building you end up wait a bunch of time on the end product   and if you want to make a really big profit you end up load a trailer with pallet with hand   use another mod   because forklift be annoying as hell   I mean they could of make it so that you park in a area and it will auto fill   like in euro truck simulator   but noooo    you know what player would love   load pallet one by one with a forklift that take forever to pick up a pallet   pick up one or two pallet its a satisfying experience but not     a day just so that I don t lose that      to autosell    this game have the potential to be way well then fs     but not now   maybe latter   maybe when giant optimalise the game and fill out basic info regard gameplay element that the player should know   because I spend hour and hour make    k   to buy the oil mill so that I can make from canola canola oil and sell it to a good profit   just to learn after I buy the mill that it will take      canola to make     liter of oil and it will make   x    liter hour in game   so that mean if I want to make canola oil from    k liter canola it will take     in game hour to do so    this game look so promise   everything that you would want from a farming simulator in        but its shallow   it bring new and good idea to the table but fail to implement it to its full potential   in fact in this game the only gameplay feature that will not disappoint be the season aspect of it   that be beautiful and everything that you would expect   the sound be amass   the most realistic sound farm sim out there   it give I the chill and will immerse you to depth that you could not think be possible   just to be pull out by crow and dear spawn in front of you ever       second   ai that drive like lunatic   and lack of information that should be in game from the start    its sad that I need to download mod that fix gameplay aspect of the game   I should be download building   map or equipment   not mod that aim to correct a broken gameplay   it s sad that I spend hour up on hour on youtube look at video on how much leasing cost or what be the production rate of a factory instead of see this info in game as it should be   if you need to pay people to explain how your game work to player then something be wrong   I want to play and not run test   I want to enjoy the game and not search for way and workaround for thing that don t work or be break
farm fun
great game   super fun to play I play all the time   only spite be the lack of high resolution town and well construction clipping and function
great game
good game yet   I ve play since fs     wouldn t trade it for anything
tractor go brrrr
it s really fun when you play with one or more friend   the game allow for some great co op farming experience   and the add element of work together really enhance the gameplay    another thing I would highly recommend be use mod   the game have a vast modding community   and there be ton of great mod available that can add even more depth and variety to the game   from new equipment to new crop    I do have to mention that the game have its fair share of bug   I ve experience several glitch and issue that have affect my gameplay   while they don t ruin the overall experience   they can be frustrating at time    I would give farming simulator     a      star   it s a fun game to play with friend and have a lot of potential with mod
rock   no I mean there s rock every time I do anything   overall   nothing you can t do here in       with mod except be annoy by rock   slight improvement of graphic   but if you re zoom out like usually we be for this game   nothing change      map aren t as good imo    season be more of a nuisance than add anything fun    seem like less equipment for basic farming   where s my low level cultivate   fertilize seeder      more equipment that s useless   really I m go to farm olive   maybe high tier later when I have million for a gimmick     find the contract to be less profitable than       and often not worth it    find bailer to be too sensitive on pick up material   wasn t worth the money to I   not yet anyhow   I m still try to figure it out but I wouldn t have spend     buck know what I know now
multiplayer have not work correctly since day     can never find a friend s server or a rent server in the list   no invite button to invite friend either   do yourself a favor and avoid this game
   cool game   farming simuliator    
its bussin
great game to relax   good mud graphic and beautiful detail
annoyingly addict   though I will say a lot of thing have piss I off in this game   the ai be really annoying   but even then   the mod database build into the game and make a core feature fix almost everything   it just make the game work   there be constant experimentation even without all the dlc   so if you be interested   i d say buy it and give it a try
finally they introduce proper steering wheel support   it take like      year or much more   I m bad at math       be       some physics improvement on top of that make this easily the version that introduce the most important addition and overall improvement to build   time and the big addition which be winter and snow    also you can drive trough most fence   it s a miracle    other thing include improve grass farming   improve bale mechanic like size of bale go from      to     cm and some small and big than that   improve round bale transportation trailer   pick up rock   rolling ground after sow and other cool stuff     con add in review               strange worker behavior at time when play on haut beyleron where sometimes they win t move at all   like they re just brain dead on where to go      train price on crop be absolutely dumb in my opinion    it s literally the easy way to store and get rid of crop and it s still the most valuable as the price for train stop be always the high   which mean you have absolutely no reason to sell crop to any other store      strange bug with the train at random where it ll be in an infinite loop   thankfully rare now      snow be cool initially    but after the snow begin go inside my cockpit    well    that ruin it      the animal add be absolutely dumb    to a point where I feel they could ve just leave they out honestly    either they get run over by car   they re invincible   or they just straight up run into my tractor or they begin run over water like that long haired dude they keep mention from       year ago    or the crow    they just randomly spawn out of nowhere    shouldn t it be seagull   that s what I see most of when I work in the farming industry      sometimes bale will randomly begin move by themselves when you get close to they with the baler     and that be freak annoying    constantly have to reposition      some crop sell area have roof on they    most trailer be way too long and will always clip trough    which    again    immersion break    that s about it for the con for now    if you re go by visual when it come to the game and not engine improvement   then just stick with     and it s mod though    but if you re like I and like a well hard difficulty and easy steering wheel setup   then get this
   beginner beware    after notice the cult follow grow with fs     I be excited to get involve this time around with what should be a aaa game by now   sadly   it be not    at good   this be the most in depth version of gmod with its ridiculous physics in tow   whack a stop sign in a     ton fully load truck and you ll stop dead   clip a box of egg at speed and you ll roll an entire bloody tractor   the game be also lock to    fps to hide the shortcoming of the ancient engine it run on    next thing to know be this be a sandbox game from the absolute beginning   despite you start   career mode    everything be available from the start and there be nothing to strive towards other than the satisfaction of grow a crop from start to finish    the   tutorial   can be complete in less than a minute and you be leave wonder what the hell to do from there   this game require incredible amount of google and youtube tutorial before you can do anything    despite this year version feature hireable ai worker to plow some field for you   they be incredibly stupid and if the field isn t perfectly square with huge amount of space to turn around outside the field   they will get stick   if two ai worker meet   they will also just sit face each other make no attempt to go around   you re still pay they while this be go on though   if you be expect automation and   run   a farming empire   this be not the game for you   the emphasis be on do every task yourself    I have now slog through      hour and by give myself      mil   I ve have finally learn the in and out of all the mechanic this game have to offer   I do actually enjoy this game now I understand it but I wouldn t wish the ridiculous learning curve on anyone and therefore can not recommend it without a huge improvement to an actual career mode that would take you through each type of farming enterprise with good yield result   step by step    this game continue to have an enormous modding community that the developer actively rely on to improve their game for they   but their emphasis seem to be on endless tractor skin rather than optimisation and quality of life improvement   would be cool if the dog could jump in my pickup come to work with I too though   
of course its good
if yah like grow stuff and be a farm hand this game be for you feller I tell yah   its realistic and highly immersive not to mention reward the expansion be fairly price and even with the base game there be so much to do   its a great game for casual or advance session you can get as simple or complex you want and I like the player have that choice   this be the ultimate agriculture simulator
the reason this be the good farming sim on the market be as it s always be   mod   it s quite unbelievable what you can get out of this   chain to attach and pull stuck vehicle out   work windscreen wiper    the devs never even think of that    why isn t this feature on snowrunner   dirt machinery wear   ton work part   snow and snow clearing auto loading log trailer   van   pallet   freight container   accurate weather   gps position   config work camera view   run production line   keep a multitude of animal   I ve have fsim since approx     and this have a lifetime of enjoyment as much as you put in you ll get out    the only downside be worker ai path finding be a mess   tell they to drive a lorry to a lumber mill   from a forest road and they just sit there cost you money   basic farm work be fine but this have forestry in the platinum pack   ai traffic be another useless feature   turn it off   address this and it would be nigh on perfect   ton and ton of mod   more than you can think of to make the game yours
it s funny    when you tell someone that you like play farming simulator everyone look at you like your crazy hehe   but it s not hard to convince anyone why I like it   most even say   well that make sense     it s the big machinery     you can walk around it   inspect it and play with   you literately feel like a boy again   get to play with the grow up toy s hehe   also the simple bliss you feel by drive they around do simple task and then reap the reward    I m sorry but it s just so satisfying   I sometimes get lose and spend like      hour in the game and when I get up and leave I have only manage to handle one or two field or take care of the farm animal and do the daily delivery run to town with good      but I still feel relaxed and always leave with the feeling that I spend good quality time in the game   that s what I love about farming simulator    you forget yourself in it   but in a good way  
edit   farming simulator      premium edition be now available for purchase by those with the base game   I be glad that it be probably a bug or misunderstand that previously prevent the purchase   which have now be fix   it s very good that the developer solve the problem and take care of their fan   in november there will be another dlc   with a map from central europe and new crop and vehicle that I be very much look forward to   the map be include in season pass       old   I don t know if it s a mistake or greed of the developer   but it s pathetic that during the sale   people who want to buy f    for the first time have the opportunity to buy the bundle of the base game seasonpass   sp    pln        zl   at a significant discount   and for a person who purchase the game at launch   it be not possible to purchase this bundle   ultimately   it turn out that someone who already own the game must spend the same amount on a single season pass     pln        zl   or sp    pln        zl   as a person who be just buy the bundle    base game sp   sp    pln        zl    this be how developer care about their fan and treat player who buy the game for the premiere   it s sad and pathetic   I will not write about the fact that fs    be the same as fs    
fs    be defiantly a step up in the farming simulator franchise    nice graphic nice attention to detail nice model    animation nice collection of equipment in the base game nice interface nice easy customisation of game setting lot to do and manage   like a real farm    all around it s very good   well with friend though in my opinion
lovely game    if you once get in touch with the mechanic   you will understand how everything work     so when you find everything out   you will have fun   love the animal   so cute   I love be a farmer with my farmer friend obu   very nice game   you well get it now    get goo goo alu       
a welcome step forwards from        I actually have more than the      hour   it isn t count they for some reason   yes   there be bug   yes performance be stuttery   and yes the content isn t super substantial   it s about on par with fs     and its expansion   the graphic have improve a good bit and the gameplay be enjoyable   the new addition make it a genuinely relax experience   the stuttering and performance issue can be fix pretty easily   unlike a massive aaa shooter I refund to buy this   look up the farming sim     fps unlock tutorial   the game be soft lock to     fps for the physics engine and this lead to a stuttery experience because the game temporarily throttle framerate when it jump above      this lead to a stutterf that last a few second   especially when switch to first person in the vehicle   this be easily solve by a simple xml edit that allow the game to go high   I be sit at      gpu usage before the fix with some rough stutter   now I m at        usage at     fps and the stutter be very few and far between   the good part be the physics seem to still function normally   once the modding community transition over to      this will be a highly recommend jump up   who ever think a farming sim would get a high rating and have a smooth launch experience than the massive aaa failure this year
ever want to be a farmer   well here it be   with physics that will throw you up into the stratosphere sometimes and other make sense   good fun   well with friend
good game
amazing game with great physics and awesome graphic   probably the good farming game out there
love the game and hope they work on the semi as it get stuck alot
super good
this game be fun
this game be a big step in the right direction for the fs series    there be some thing wrong with it but I m sure will be fix   still a brand new game just about a week old so it will have stuff wrong    but I will highly say try this game you ll like it
giant be a joke   its time for a new developer    we wait what   an extra year for this game and its just the same game since       onwards   yeah the sound be well   there s crossplay   but for goodness sake what have change    its the same game every year   I want dynamic ground   well physics   screenshot mode   adjustable seat   well mirror   the list go on    mark my word the same game will release in few year
with a ryzen    and rtx      I ve not be able to get stable playable framerate even on medium graphic setting   all other game play fine   I you purchase   check performance   then refund if no good   I perserve with it too long   lesson learn
this be an absolutely amazing game   very immersive and addictive with load to do   however I have have endless issue with the multiplayer system   it do not work properly   I play with friend on pc and my brother on ps   but try to get the server to show up on the server list prove challenge      of the time   one day we can be try for     min   continuously refresh and restart console pc s and it still doesn t show up   sometimes however it do work after     min of restart   no setting change   no mod add   just seem to work when it feel like it   which isn t very often   if anyone from the developer team can get in touch to sort out the problem then please do   but if you be sell a game with a work multiplayer system then I can not recommend thus game
it s very fun once you know how to play and start to make money
a real step up from the disappointment that fs    be    it s cool
come from someone who have play hundred of hour from all the previous farming simulator game   I have to say I think this might be the bad one yet   its clear to I that this franchise be not interested in improve the gameplay experience   but rather just milk the same old game for content that modder already make well year ago     the physic be the bad than farm sim       and the ai farmer follow suit with the trend   graphic be no different to       maybe even bad   game still have all the stupid bug   do not even get I start on the ai traffic   its simply just a money grab and a pathetic rebrand of the old title   stick to whatever farming sim you unfortunately own right now and get mod to make up for the lack of content   I want this rubbish game refund
support pedal   shifter   and a wheel   I can be a farmer in real life   just without the economical stress of course
tractor go      mph        
       you can drive a forklift
this game have some serious crash and frame rate issue   do not purchase      
gud
there be issue with this game that do not work as they should   how many year have this be out   just keep make a   new   version right   stock map or not pathe hasn t work well   good thing for mod   ya it s a nice game   but don t pay full price   you can buy key that be cheap   save money as there seem no effort to fix issue in the game    do not let the faithful to the game convince you to spend full price   hrs play do not mean one love the game   so find it cheap   then take the extra money and spend it on something like ice cream eh
immersion be very high   amazed at the amount of detail and realism   support by the extensive build in modhub and community support base   modhub handle the install etc   configuration flexibility be outstanding and a model for other to follow   only one small suggestion   I would love some feedback interaction with an advisor in game   hey   maybe you should get those potato in before      or   would you like some help with the transport of that to a loading bay   and       yield on that one    do you know that you can put lime on that field and improve it by     
I think this be farm sim     when I launch it       
likefor the game minus for stupid friend who do not want to play with I   now I m cry
my friend always ask I what I find so fun about this game   and the top reason be that there s always so much to do   you never really run out of thing to do in the game if you venture into different variety of work   variety of work include animal   crop   and production line   and if you be wait for a helper to finish a large field you can always accept contract   I be personally look forward to the platinum expansion   the platinum expansion be set to bring so many new feature to the game such as construction   new way of log and a variety of new production chain to expand in   to sum up   the game bring satisfaction   at an end of an in game month you can sit back know you ve do everything there be to be do on the farm and then sleep until the next month day to enjoy it all again
first real farming sim out of the series I ve         into and my god have I be suck in       hour first sit   wake up and then play an additional     hour   I really wish some friend play but play solo you can get by just fine use the a i function to cultivate and seed plot or deliver your good   but for anyone look for a really good time waster with a purpose this will make you feel like you ve accomplish something after you ve spend the last    hour get plot of land ready and finally harvest those sunflower   I do minimise the game a little since I m wait for thing to grow   but that single moment you have enough money to buy something the game suck you in again and you find yourself cut down tree or grow lettuce in a green house   I really can t wait to start raid some chicken and cattle to sell some more good    for anyone first start out with a farming sim game   I highly recommend play on standard normal difficulty as the easy setting just give you a bunch of stuff   bunch o   money and already ready plot of land   I lean the game a ton fast by use the standard difficulty which get you to buy your own land and figure out which vehicle you need yourself
the game be amazing to past time and teach kid how to manage thing
your pass   edition   bundle do not make any sense   if you really want to play this   buy the base game and mod it
I use to play fs    and play this have be very nostalgic   the graphic be great and so much have improve since then but it be the same great game it be before   really nice to play after a stressful day   just sit down and mess with my virtual farm

hello   my name be oleksandr   I m from ukraine   I love play farming simulator   the game be very interesting   allow you to take a break from everyday task   but I would like to see my native localization in the game   developer   please add ukrainian localization to the game   we have be wait for this for a long time
so many improvement and new thing add to game play   mad respect for giant for put out the good sim series so far   now if they could only go the route of scs and add more content and giant engine upgrade instead of release a new game every      year
you accidentally run over your own cow with a combine harvester    end
so far so good I just wish that the industry have more option and that we could go into the shop
if you have ever own any prior version of this game then don t waste your money on this   this game peak around fs    or fs     these guy keep re sell the exact same game over and over again at full price ever since fs     each new version have very minor change which be not worth the price   bad be the cruft that should have be fix long ago still linger on from version to version   the main map of this game be full of bug such as invisible artifact that you run into which then havok your equipment   the food ratio calcuation for animal pen be still a huge mess and doesn t work properly   especially for pig   I love the concept of this game and I enjoy play these type of tycoon game   but these guy need to ditch this tired old game engine   and stop with the minimal effort new release which they over charge their customer for   call this a   simulator   with a straight face be more than a bit of a stretch   it be a tycoon game that need a   serious   overhaul build with a modern game engine   this brand new game feel like it be      year old
this be by far one of the good simulator on the market   I have learn much about farming as well as the management involve   the depth that be possible with the parameter give the ability to be as involved or not as any level of player that would like to try it out   with the ability to get modification for the game there be soo many different option whether they be in the game or attainable in other mean   with all that say I be certain many would agree that there be much anticipation in the upcoming release of the late version   the only thing that I feel be difficult be have many mod and not be able to join or host many game with all the mod instal   which easily can be turn off   in any case this be clearly one of the good game for any and all level of play   especially give a sincere interest   I would suggest this game to everyone give the chance
the game itself be great   or I wouldn t have play it for      hour   except for the forestry   where the texture doesn t match the model hitbox unless the tree be super straight    but the multiplayer be terrible   it start with the fact that you still can t connect with friend via steam and have to hope that a friend s server will be suggest to you   sometimes you have to restart the game      time for that to happen   but sometimes you see the server as soon as it start   once you ve find the server   you have to spend        second sync the game datum   pause the game for everyone   then repeat the previous process   because sometimes terraforme object or texture be set to default locally   which be then fix by reconnecte   then when you be finally in the game   desync or rubberbanding occur   I don t know of any other game where this be so extreme   the multiplayer be the only thing besides mod that keep the game alive   so it s even sad that it s so poorly implement   I really hope these issue be fix in the next installment and be disappointed that even farm simulator       run more stable
I know what you re think       hour and the game be not recommend   that doesn t sound right    well let I tell you I enjoy the heck out of the previous title and I be really look forward to this one   I buy the game in its   finish   state with all the dlcs and I have spend all those hour try to find the fun in the game   convince that if I just do something different I can finally enjoy myself and build my dream farm    I m sure there s a good game in there somewhere   but the game and its system be constantly get in your way of   well     farming   unless your preferred play style be run a small hobby farm on one of the pre build farm that the game offer you re go to run into frustration and disappointment    any dream you may have of build your own farm on more than a couple of hectare of land   well I hope you have more patience for jankiness and   what the heck do I do with all this straw   than I do   the map be gorgeous   but try to place anything like a cow barn require a dance of save   terraforming   attempt to place the thing you want   find out you didn t do it right   quit and reload your save   it get tedious very quickly and because the game be a single save per farm   there s no way to make manual save to either go back to a previous state for your farm or save individual step so that you can   say   adjust your terraforming before try again without start completely over    yes   there s a way to make manual backup of your save on pc   no that doesn t really help     I have plenty of other example of thing and system in the game that end up frustrate I and ultimately I couldn t even solve with mod   I can only hope that farm sim     spend time polish all these pain point and not just add new crop with minimal support   grape and olive anyone    and pretty graphic
farm
can t even load the server list   tell I I can not connect to the server and to restart the computer   eat my sack fs  
step in the right direction with plenty of new feature   gearbox   season   sound   stone in the field and a really good building mode improve immersion   the helper system be far well than before    the devs take a lot of point from my wishlist   ground deformation be now on top of the   still miss feature   list
this game suffer from the      step forward      step back approach   I play the previous farming simulator       title and enjoy it when it be release   I have also work in agriculture and be familiar with the real life equivalent   please bear in mind this review be just my    cent opinion   at the end of the day it s your time   your money and I hold no judgement against anyone that like this game    the game be presentable enough   but for the price it feel a lot like a beta release   the standard draw distance be quite frankly terrible   when I be play with a friend on flat ground   he and the bale in the paddock would appear and disappear on every run up and down the paddock   another time I be harvest corn and the machine keep harvesting outside of the dimension of the cutting bar   which I personally find irksome   petty I know    the microtransaction be not a nice addition   from different edition of the game   expensive dlc when compare to free mod and feature you expect to be in the base game   I can only speculate the giants software pay for licensing from many of these company that essentially advertise to the player   just say    in addition I have have a lot of stability issue on my end   which be not hardware issue in the sense that I have a contemporary rig with a        waste a lot of time get the game to run without crash be common for I   with direct x      not run the game in administrator mode    graphic card update break the game   although I can not lay all these issue at giant software   the game seem to suffer from optimization bug which when search for on the web date back to this game release and have to be solve by you to work around     imho the game be not worth the full price tag and lack the care and attention that would make this game really amazing   I will probably continue to play it from time to time with my friend   even with give this game a down vote   please continue to support the mod   they fill in all the gap that player like myself want to see   grateful to they    if you finish read this review   thank you for your time   have a great day
waste of money   farm sim     way well   it will be awhile before this one have enough new content to make it worth your time and     keep play fs     and wait for this one to go on sale
my electric toothbrush have well ai than this game
tractor
very good farm
I have really like this game   but I buy the platinuim edition and then I have to buy year    pack for     pound   nope just nope   this be become a f         cash grap   so I m out   
it a really good game for those who want to farming like in real like
atm it be a big pile of bug    no matter what the fs fanboy tell u here   the big new ai feature be a failure these guy be to stupid to know where your field be eventhough they be at a straight road away from they    or try to turn inside a unloading point to get back to a field   optimisation my ass   it stutter bad then a full modde f      drive a truck in reverse and the wheel on different axel spin in different direction   or they spin and do not move the truck   do it look great yeah sure    but the gameplay bug mess up the fun for I right now
I ve play fs    and fs     I quit play those because the only there be never any improvement on the physic model and the ai worker    what have change since   we get more vehicule   more crop   season   nice    and production chain   from the farm to your table   but still the same physic model and the dumb ai worker   the physic model and ai have not evolve a single bit for the past     year   this game feel like a big f    dlc   but you can t charge         for a dlc now   can you    I honestly feel like I ve be rip off   I m do
as someone that s play hundred of hour of fs    and love every minute of it   at this time   I can t recommend the game right now   it s actually a bit tough to make a review like this but there be a lot of thing that just don t impress I   the devs talk about high fps ingame   yet we re still lock at    fps even with v sync off   they boast about have       vehicle and tool in the game but it feel like they gutte a lot of the brand down to      item that have a much big presence in fs     seed usage when it come to plant grass be way too high   a field that s just a bit over    ac take over      l of seed to put grass in it   the silos that require the conveyor   big pain in the butt I ve have to deal with so far   they don t even stay put when you park it   there s a handful of other issue I have and I just don t feel like this game should of take    year to develop when they didn t really add anything huge other then rock and new sound and texture for thing   maybe if they work out some of these issue down the road   I can recommend it   but I d give it time to cook a bit more before spend the money on a copy paste of fs    with a few new texture and sound
let I start by state that I do like the game   but it have many old   persistent problem that need to be address by the developer    let I start with the dedicated server situation   so I want to host a dedicated server for my friend to play on   without I have to sit there and have the game run        reasonable   right   well     host a dedicated server   and play on it require a separate copy of the game   along with every dlc pack that you would like to include   yes   if I want to host a server   I have to buy the game twice   the shoddy excuse give by giant that this somehow prevent   piracy   be just pathetic   as you still use their server browser to connect to game   the amount of scrounge for money on this one be insane and very anti consumer           and these problem be nothing new   the server paywall have be here for age   the game feel old from the engine and the buggy physics   the greedy decision to make essential functionality mod pay be abhorrent   and the mismanaged season pass be just the icing   on this manure cake   and for I   it overshadow the pretty fun game behind it   I ll continue to play it   but don t intend to support this series in the future   unless there be some positive change make by giant    or maybe I m just too principled like that
just note if you buy the season pass it will not cover all that year dlc which be kinda disappointing and make no sense   currently pump and hose be extra even if you own the year    season pass
one of the big upgrade in the series   great new ui   plenty of mod as usual         
gud
pretty fun game   here and there some bug    but with the time it will get fix

it run very smooth   it have a lot of feature that be already available as mod in fs     production chain and greenhouse for example   overal a fantastic game   street ahead of fs     would definitely recommend if you like sim game

   soybean good    u
verry good
if you be look for farming and more game on any scale this game be for you
the bad save system I have ever see    giant make game since       and somehow they screw it more than small of indie      no backup    ok   that s fine as long save be safe     saving be not a safe process   f remove your save and then make a new one   you can lose hour of progress if anything go wrong   be it really that hard to make temp file and then rename they      autosave trigger when   and only when you open menu     saving prevent you from do anything   but     it do not pause the game
disclaimer   this review be subject to change   super buggy release   to put it short   I ve be a huge fan of the series   even follow it before the release of the first iteration in        however   give the time and money they ve have to create this version   I m quite disappointed   it s be the long time since two release three yeear   and the price tag have increase by yet another      really   I m fine with both of those if it wasn t for the lack of improvement and new feature    currently   there be a bunch of bug and issue that keep I from enjoy this game as much as I could   I ll just name whichever of those go through my head right now    multiplayer be super unstable   for two reason   some console player have issue with connect to the point where they be unable to partake in mp   this be confirm by lot of player throughout discord and the giants forum   same go for the fact that the server be massively overload during peak hour   you can notice this by the fact that you be hardly able to enter the server browser anywhere between    and    pm gmt    there s a bug that freeze your tractor and render it useless if you be use the big bag equipment until you reset it to the dealership   if anyone need help with this   use the map to reset the tractor to the dealership   then restart the game   that s the fix for now    the absolute lack of documentation for how game feature behave   there be a few ingame hint but really   they ve leave so many question mark throughout the community   it s just sadden   and the   farming academy   they ve release on the game page be at like      completeness    there s a bug that render direct seeder useless    the fact that   despite how they ve botch the release   they still be already sell a season pass for big money and start a dlc shop with single vehicle for       each   that s huge money   the absence of communication about what s happen on their side ever since the launch   people be just leave on their own with the broken mp and community assistant deliberately avoid answer question about this on their discord   I ve ask question about some of my mention bug but never get a response from an active community manager   however   inbetween the time I ve ask   they ve be very quick with respond to question about the delay release for the mac os   even upon start a personal conversation   I be unable to receive an answer about my issue which   imho   be a red flag for customer assistance    the ai helper be just as dumb as it have be since it s release in the     iteration of the game   however   they ve now add a   semi autonomous helper   which do nothing more than drive to a preset point   original map in the game have field that be not perfectly square shape and the helper struggle with those   noticeable because you ll be leave with small patch of unworked soil on field that   for example   have round corner
I ve be a farmer my whole life   I ve also be a gamer my whole life   with that say I have no idea how this game have manage to last this long     oh wait I do know how   they manage to sue every single game company in the farming simulator gaming market   quite literally sue everyone into the ground and trade mark everything in the game so basically if you make a game that resemble farming at all   you re prolly getting sue by farm sim   don t buy this game   you literally have to download      s of mod just to make it playable past       hour of gameplay
I enjoy play fs     I be enjoy fs    even more   there be something so satisfying about farming and get to play with expensive farming machinery   there be so much to do in this game I haven t even scratch the surface with animal or production chain yet    the game run great on a gtx     ti and I usually have no problem    the ai be miss the   I   most of the time   there be room for improvement with send an ai off to deliver something   it be also very cool when it work correctly    the secret sauce for fs    be the mod   I have over      mod so far in my playthrough    they fix the minor or major quality of life issue and they be easy to add to the game    if you be on the fence about get fs     just buy it   there be almost endless thing to do
so many basic   simple error bug that should not be in a   th gen version of this game   even fs    fs    fs    f    f    perform and run well than this piece of console port crap   if the production chain where not in this version   it would be useless and pointless as gaint have not do anything with livestock   potato or sugar beat crop and why no manure with the greenhouse   yes the machine include be great and the olives grape be wonderful but you could not even be bother to fix simple thing   like the orchid sprayer fan not turn or the view the the spray can only be be from one side yet you have    water partical plain all face in the same direction   how easy would it have be to check fix this    guess you be all to busy chase chicken   the performance be real bad   if I turn all setting up then I be lucky to get    fps on window      rysen          gb ram   rtx      super use g   monitor at      x       this have the bad performance than all the game in my steam lib   hell even all my gog game run fast than this    
feel the same as     nice graphic    ai suck in this one really bad   the price for maintenance and painting omg   to paint my cotton machine    k lmao or the tractor    k   still feel like drive on pavement wherever you go I really think they would make the ground physics a little well but that have not change   snow on the ground be terrible I turn that off zero ground physics drive through snow   and its buggy when cover in snow the blink on the road be terrible   I feel this be the same game     they name it     to charge      for the game   get     with all the current expansion and mod the     be well   change my mind  
bingus the pringus
the optimization be pretty bad   always stutter here and there   should have believe the youtuber on this one   because everyone s game stutter
this game be well     farming simulator   giant have make some improvement from the last game which be good but I don t think that it be worth the    year long wait for a new fs game
it be good
the game be realistic with the season growth   graphic   trailer   and all the machinery in it   but the game be pretty new and there be some little bug and I believe they will be fix shortly   enjoy the game
reee laxe
multiplayer be break
one of the good simulator experience on the market today   it look so mundane on the surface   and be initially the reason I refund the game the first time   it have depth   it stay true to itself   there be so much you can do    the dlc be not necessary   the amazing modding community be what give this game   and the franchise as a whole   the longevity it have come to enjoy    bonus point if you live or have live in a state region that have heavy farming influence

I ve play farming simulator     for while now   so I can say my opinion about this game    first of all   stop compare fs    with f    with alot of mod   it make no sense compare a base game to another game with mod      second   no bug or crash for I   I m not sure why other people say there be alot of bug and crash   because until now I have no problem play this game   I think people should stop criticize the game and start think maybe the problem be their own computer and not the game   just say      it s definitely a master piece   a huge step from the previous game with numerous update    pro     improve graphic     machine sound much well     animal and human animation improve     texture be well     season and production chain be great     nice to be able to customise the character     well ai   still need a few improvement     and alot more    con     for I the only con might be   no terrain physics   it would make a big difference on how you play   imagine muddy when rainy and you get stick   it would be fun in my opinion    but nothing mod can t do   so be not exactly a con      overall be a amazing game
so like some I wait awhile for the game to drop it s price and maybe get a few friend together to play host a server only to realise that if you want to play multiplayer during any reasonable hour at least for   north americans   well good luck   from what I ve be see fs     server have a sort of limit and if you don t want to refresh for     minute without any luck because god forbid they have any sort of formal invite system for friend to get together   and actually find each other server    if you be on the fence about this game buy it if all you want be simple single player game play   but for a casual multiplayer game which be one of their   big point when advertise about the game   just don t give giant software your money if they refuse to do anything about this consistent issue   just really disappointing and sad  
the game be amazing so relaxing and chill to farm with friend
if you enjoy play any farming sim game   you ll enjoy this too   more and expand on feature from fs       a lot of new vehicle   good visual   while the vehicle be very detailed
can never find friend server and it need to be fix
if anyone be hesitate to get this game   I d just say    what the heck be you wait for   get in here     I d pay    time this amount and it would still be worth it   it s that good   I be hesitant to walk away from my farm on f    but   sorry fs         be you crazy    this be absolutely a knock out of the park   good job giant   well do   gg   update       hrs in   still love it   giant be make very good patch and lot of good mod map be be post and manage by very dedicated staff and player modder   it s the farm game for simulator farming   there s nothing like this

I haven t play a farming simulator thoroughly since farming simulator      decide to get back into farming simulator when     come out   I be love the grind   all the new thing and year of stuff I m very new to   the fact you can build or place down object and basically build your farm how you want it be quite amazing    however   this game really need a quality of life update and polish on a lot of flawed logic   the more I play   the more I see its many flaw   I m change my review   for the well   when the con outweigh the pro   it become a problem    they do an update   I ll test it out this weekend and change my review accordingly   not too keen on they call it a   free content update    seem smug or they want we to pay for more in the future         pro    con     they take a month to release a patch that rarely fix most issue in the game   not to mention they do silent update that be not mention in the patch note   like honey produce slow   and exist honey after the first update be destroy     server have to completely pause when a new player be join   it s annoying   I don t know how they manage to come up with such a terrible server feature   imagine that same logic in an mmo     you d never get to play                                as I say   there need to be a quality of life update to make thing well for new or return player   seem like it s cater to long term fs player
this game be brillent
bf      wish it be f       for real tho   where be the hemp       also fix the season pass   yuck
the game at it s core be good but it lack essential mechanic and multiplayer feature nearly every coop game and even old version of farming simulator have       you still can t join a steam friend from within steam and you therefor have to use the sluggish and very poor design server browser which still after a year lack a refresh button       tree have a different hitbox then the texture and in multiplayer forr work be unplayable most of the time       why the f     don t we have a torch in build mode   why do every core mechanic of early fs game have to be add thru mod                                                                                       graphic         core         mod         would suggest download the electrically power sle   mechanic           dlc         why do we need a season pass for a farming simulator
it s be    year since this game come out and it have be a blast   it bring my friend and I back together and make we connect and play more together   this game be our casual night game   it give we enough tool to create our own unique rp base mp server and keep we entertain for hundred of hour   I play a little bit more and rank up a       hour   but it could have be even high if there wasn t something call   real life     I really recommend this game and the whole fs catalog   get you some gaming buddy and go create your own escape from the terrifying thing call   real life        thank you giant for the    year   it s time for I to go to the next one   here we come fs     
I genuinely don t understand the negative review people give to this game   sure   it s very similar to      but so be     when compare to      objectively this game be pretty much the same as even fs     what people don t apparently realize be that these game franchise aren t mean to make massive leap in graphical or physical improvement   but to bring more standalone feature and small improvement compare to their predecessor   when it come to modde   I m sure fs    will become a lot well when some of the more popular mod from the previous game start to come out for this game    the handling   issue   some people seem to be have be easily fix by tweak the two steering setting   steer and handling be very personal setting   and that it have be update from f    seem to trigger some people   come on   also   anyone who doesn t see any graphical improvement to f    be either really blind or run on low setting   foliage look a million time well and lighting be a lot more pleasing in this game   some of the texture also seem much sharp and the draw distance have be vastly improve    most of the people not like this game seem to have the common   old be well    problem   when in reality the improvement be exactly what you d expect from a new addition to the series
great game and court farm map take it to another level  
I ve have this game for    day now and already have     hour on it   
this be my favorite farming sim so far   the addition of extra crop and the tweak to game mechanic have make this game absolutely phenomenal   my friend and I will boot this game up and somehow spend    straight hour planting and tend farm and find absolute hilarity in our conversation         will probably put in another      hour
the construction system in this f be by far the most refined of all the fs title   I often find myself spend hour just build my farm yard   pair this with the game change mod like maizeplus and even precision farming   f    be a very strong title
I ll give it a       the graphic be good and so be the physics
a game which need a really hard work man   but unfortunately I get no man friend I get kid only who keep play mmorpg and         league of legend etc     game
this game be amazing
fun game for a group of friend
love it
there be so much bug and glitch in multiplayer   item get desynce   savegame delete   server lagging and alot of small but irritate stuff   the game itself be amazing   but when the devloper know about the problem but be say it s just a math error and that they don t know what the error be   that s not good   it look like another rush game to just get the money from the fan of farming simulator   I really hope that these bug be fix in the next update and that I can update this review then
I m new to game   in my     s with a few health issue that keep I ground   but this   game   have get I hook   to say that I love it be an understatement   I didn t start on an in game map   but download one call no man s land that start you off on practically virgin country and let you build it up from there   my creative juice be flow like crazy   to do it justice   I invest in a steering wheel and joystick   but these be not essential   such a huge modding community too   allow you to customise the game just as you want to   so much to do on the farm   get to go now   if you ve get time on your hand   get farm sim      you really win t regret it
hey all   I will start by say I have be play the farming sim series from the start farm sim     and I have probably over all the iteration probably    k hour spend play this over the year    I really don t think this game be worth buy in its current state I have only put       hour into it since release if it be f    or fs    I would probably have around       hour by now easily I don t find the game as fun as previous game the devs at this stage be milk this graphic engine it feel like I m play a game that s    year old with the tech they be use the graphic really need to go a more modern direction it just do not feel like a new game it feel like I m play the previous    iteration with no mod he graphic just don t cut it anymore we need something new that look well the series be start to feel like the yearly fifa release a few extra piece of content but nothing else have change   they have add alot of new content such as production building which I find great to be include in the base game what I do not find great be all the new thing they have add feel like they have all be   rush   they just do not work in a way I find very fun bread for example I usually play    x its so slow to make bread its not even worth do unless you have atleast   x bakery plant then the next problem you run into be the map size I really do not like the way this game be head it seem the pc gamer be be restrict by the console the standard map size be tiny I like play on big   x american map etc the small field on the base fs    I find I get bore very quickly there just to small to I come from modded fs     x map I would rather spend    hour harvest one large field than spend    minute each on    small field    the game just feel very bland I would rather just hop back on fs    until maybe in    month fs    have have its bug and the modder have add alot of the miss equipment that honestly I be expect in the base game the borgault dlc from fs    I expect to be in f    at release it have alot of nice big equipment that fs    be really lack there be not many seeder or small harvester but there be about     end game harvester it just seem very unbalanced equipment wise and very bare bone    there be just too much bug and performance issue I have play on both my      ti game rig and my       laptop and if I try to play without nvidia dlss turn on the frame spike and stuttering be bad on both system no matter if on medium or ultra setting   when dlss be turn on I do not like the blurry look of the game but I find the stutter with it turn off make the game unplayable for I I be very sensitive to motion sickness and this game be one of the bad game I have have make I feel physically sick    I do see this eventually turn out to be a decent game in maybe    month for now I would pick fs    up on the cheap and play that the season mod from fs    be ton well than what giant have try to implement in fs    its a water down version and leave much to be desire    they have add alot of new thing that I feel just be poorly implement and feel very buggy   until some of the decent mod come out and a decent size map I could quite happily not play this for another    month there be nothing about this game that I find want I to keep play it and after      hour I feel like I m   do   with the game already it usually take I around     k hour to start even get bore with any of the previous game and for the first time ever regret buy this on release there be just too much stuff miss that should have be there from the get go     pro s   the sound be much well than f    be able to buy use equipment from the dealer production in base game gearbox in base game slightly well bale handling   pallet handling over previous game the game will be much well because of the modder in   month    con poor optimization graphic be poor by today s standard bug lackluster range of start equipment   end game equipment animal implementation poorly do   less capacity than previous game still have poor size base map base game season be junk compare to the modded fs    season by realismus modding no gps in base game    restrict by console player I assume
before game release   where to start with this game   I wasn t someone that pre order the game but it seem that doesn t matter anyway   anything you get for pre order you can just get in the dlc shop   so you get like     worth of free stuff    nice   even before release of the official game they post a season pass that you can buy   their isn t even content for the pass yet   nor will there be anytime soon   how can you make a purchasable content pass without actually know what be in the content   and I quote     pack     this will drive you crazy    really giant   the pass even go as far to say   additional content in the year    pass   the only content in it right now be a dlc tractor that you can get for      that isn t additional content   a season pass worth      and you be put filler for content   almost       for a non aaa title and some jpeg season pass   in the farming simulator discord we often get some update on what will be come to the game   most of these update didn t come until the week before the actual game come out   we didn t get update on the game until it be almost release   who care about all the update post about vehicle and feature if it be two day before the release of the game    actual game play   I really be not sure what game I be play   be this farming simulator     or be it      the graphic be almost a copy paste   the main difference in the game be one look like a farming game and the other look like a space simulator   seriously   what be with all the blue in the gui   when you open the menu their be about     different tab you can look at   dear lord how difficult do you need to make it   the whole game be blue   I get you want to keep a theme with the number     but my god   the base game be just garbage in my humble opinion   they say ton of vehicle be come to     but at what cost   we already have a ton of vehicle in     that the player base love to use   then you remove all those vehicle and add a couple of new brand with only one thing in the category   don t worry though   I be sure you will get all those vehicle back after you pay a nice price of      for some season pass   sure you can go out and say mod will fix this    but that be just it   the game be in a state where modder will take the time to fix what the community want   sadly that isn t the modder job    that be giant job   you know   the people that be suppose to develop the game   the game have bug that will break game save and multiplayer doesn t work half the time   server crash constantly    the ai be a joke at good   worker be the same as fs     you would think they would take the time to improve the ai if they be add a pre version of course play to the game   but no   the same garbage ai with more complex thing they have to do   what about the ai car   they be the same just quick   I swear some time my whole tractor be in the street and they will just smack right into it   this isn t a demolition derby match   but if it be I would still be lose   some how these ai car have      hp and weigh      ton   if you have the versatile with      hp you would still get fling by the ford sedan do    mph   of course this game do have well sound   the vehicle really do sound like they be work   the gear be slow if you don t have a power shifter   it add a new level to the game the other have not have   the game seem to run smooth than fs     that be say some map you will get well fps than other   they also take the time to add something modder have be do for the community   that be say they still do season worse   compare to the fs    and fs    version of season   it just feel empty    rock   who on the dev team say   yes   let add rock that the community will have to remove every time they plow or cultivate a field   so many thing that the community want and you add rock   oh boy   I love pick up rock every time I touch my field   weed and rock   time of my life   they also only give you    tool to pick up rock   mind you they all cost half a tractor in price and only pick up two meter at a time   have fun pick up rock off your      acre land with    meter radius   at least if we have the option to turn they off it would be manageable   but we didn t even get that   maybe you can have the ai do it    sike they can t even stay on the field because hit tree and think their job be do be still a thing    repair   what be up with repair   I feel half my game play be move rock and repair my tractor   mind you it be like    k but really   I do one task or drive around the map and my tractor already lose       now think of all the thing that you be go to have on your farm   so every four month you get to fix four tractor   nine implement   two wheel loader    e t c   sound fun doesn t it   the dealer also want    k to   repaint my tractor    well I guess in the end it doesn t matter because the visual doesn t change much no matter how damage your paint be   not to mention rock will make the repair go down    old content   what happen to all the tractor everyone use to use   you pull the quadtrac out of the game   big bud aren t there anymore   some trailer just grow leg and leave   why pull so much stuff out of the game   isn t the point of make a farming simulator game every      year after the late to make it well   but it be ok   the mod community will once again come around and make the game standard to what it should be   maybe a mod will come out to fix this space gui they add   maybe we will be able to remove rock in a couple of month   because that would have be such a hard feature to add in the base game   even the fs    menu look well than this blue    f    or fs     if I could refund fs    I would do it in a heartbeat   it be sad how similar it be to f     but the blue   don t forget the       ton of blue the game have    f    at the moment be just a well game in general   the mod for the game be through the roof and at a steal price of        you be set   f    should not be worth an aaa title price   it be the only game on steam I have buy for an aaa price at launch and I would never do it again   if you would like to save yourself the disappointment that be fs    just go to      if you be currently play on      just stay on      at the moment you aren t miss anything   in fact you have more on that game then fs    will have for month   bug be also less of a problem    from another   happy farming
community most request feature still not implement after many year gps    super buggy at launch as usual   multiplayer sync break af altough it now sync when join super fast   but you basicly need to enter and exit the menu constantly to have everything sync continueisly like a real multiplayer game   mp be why I get this game in the first place so this be a huge deal to I
if you use an nvidia gpu don t purchase this game    when your graphic driver update you may no long be able to play your game   know issue since at least       from a cursory search for solution   possible solution I find so far   create restore point before you let nvidia change your driver   don t become complacent   run in dx    look it up yourself   if you aren t bother by play crysis on your flip phone   avast antivirus hate this game so put in an exception    not go to refund this mess since I get it on sale for a pittance but I be still not happy   german be well know for solid and reliable coding but be slow to adapt to change so I ll hold out hope I can play my game again sometime after fs    and before fs    release
I have to say that this game be actually damn good if you just buy the base game and plan to use quite a few mod   that say   giant have a habit of regurgitate content in a new color and call it   new    they have very rarely add any meaningful feature to the game that modder didn t do the work for they already   it s the same cycle of release   dlc s   platinum premium edition   and more dlc s    new   machine old machine reskinne as something else    about     year of farming simulator and I have never see an actual expansion from they   they just don t seem genuine or to even value consumer   opinion   people have be make the same complaint for year and it keep go to this day    so if you just buy the base game and play with mod you ll probably be surprised at how much fun it can be while also be very calm   just don t spend any money on the garbage upgrade and dlc s   modder do it well than giant do themselves
game in general be good   reason why it s a negative review be cause of the multiplayer            I constantly can not see my friend server and we have to restart the server like      time a day
   kkonaw
many feature not work    wire xbox controller not all function work   complete contract only show      complete so no earning   many other issue with game play although on a high spec window pc the graphic be well   extremely disappointed would rather play on fs    still till this be work properly
this be the third version of this franchise I play   have hundred of hour of fun with fs     so one would expect that fs    would be ton of fun to play as well   because most in game mechanic stay as they be in the predecessor   and it surely be possible to enjoy some hour of this game   but for I that s it   after the excitement the disillusionment settle in   some example     because of the new month and season structure there be a number of month you have to wait between sowing and harvesting   in the mid and late game that s no problem   because you have enough to do anyway   but at the beginning you prepare your field s   and wait   luckily it s possible to skip month if you have a house   when I play there be two house in the game   without mod   which both be pretty expensive   so no skipping for I     then there be the season with a nice and cozy winter   feature zick zack border of the snowy area and people walk the same    m route again and again while wear the same t shirt they wear in summer     another new major feature be the production chain   the idea sound great and I be pretty excitet to turn my wheat into some nice bread   so as soon as I could buy my own mill and bakery I do exactly that   why wouldn t I   the return on invest increase with every production step you add   so let s get rich   what I didn t concider be the time require to transfer and load a lot of palette between each production step   this doesn t add any fun   it s just something you have to do again and again and again   oh look there re planthouse now   nice   oh they produce palette as well     now I have a lot time two palette   at least I don t need to hurry transport they because sell a palette of fluffy bread after two year of wind and weather seem to be absolutly fine for the manager of the local discounter     there re renewable energy source now   which be great   you can buy solarpanel   place they on your land and let they permanently generate a nice amount of passive income for you   at least that s what the estimate average money per month hint make you dream of   the real return be pretty disappointing   but hey   free money    so here s what to do   get the mod to add the tiny house   which be lovely design btw   and be affordable at the beginning   take all your initial money leave and buy as many solar panel as you can   let the age of skip begin   enough money to buy new solar panel   buy more solar panel   once you re happy with your passive income   skip some more month and buy enough land   machinery or what every be require to play the game as you like and without the requirement to every skip again because you always have plenty to do   for the bazillion of pallete   dig a hole   place a trailer in it   take a plow and push the pallete onto the trailer   sadly the   two year old bread   buying manager doesn t accept upside down pallete   so ignore they bcs who acutally need the money of sell bread anyway   you now have infinite solar money    conclusion   for I personally none of the new feature actually add fun to the game   some part of the implementation   like shirt in the winter   work in quite the oppsite way and make you ask   how can this be the most successful farming simulator franchise    so many selled copy every      year and some old mechanic still seem to have the same problem they have two version ago    I would love to buy the next fs if I can expect to experience situation and feature that make I think    nice   they finally fix that    and   wow   you can feel the love to detail in the implementation of this new mechanic    but that s what I think for fs    as well
this game be absolutely a breath of fresh air from the garbage of      I be run a       with    gb of ram along with an i   processor   I can without a doubt tell you   if the game isn t run the good its because your system be a dinosaur   I say this because recommend setting be a       along with minimum at a       I have see comment about their be a lack of equipment   well honestly let s compare apple to apple   base game fs     be a complete joke for equipment and nightmare with the frame issue   base game     be smooth even on multiplayer   and also have an insane amount of vehicle along with new equipment placeable   in regard to there be no quadtrak for the love of god get over it   karl farm will have one bring over from     in      week top   yes week not month or even year to bring mod over from     literal day till you get your precious mod   this community be absolute dog water when it come to anything new   we truly have a masterpiece here people and your still stick in the dark age   we as a community ask for well sound and ai to take our grain produce and sell in base game   guess what they deliver and I be actually dig it   yes there be bug get the hell over it   the game literally come out     hour ago give it a chance   to the people who be post negative review but still rack up hour   stfu get off your high horse and keep play the game because you know its well than    
warn   multiplayer be not work properly   if you host a server sometimes it will not show up in the server browser so your friend can not join   there be not even a way to connect via ip   this multiplayer connect system be the bad of the world   shame on this
imagine you rent a dedicated server   you know the ip and port but you just can t connect because you have to use the game browser which be consistently down   no way to connect to your own server if their server be go again   unfortunately can not refund but this be just inacceptable
play fs    and     in the past   I can definitely recommend f    even though it still have a few bug and issue which they will hopefully resolve in the near future   graphic look well   mostly particle and animation   and the sound be heavily improve   game feel way smooth than fs      they have definitely optimize the game
I enjoy farming simulator     for the ps   so when I finally get my gaming pc build and hear this be come out I have to buy it and I enjoy it as much as farming simulator       
I m gay
worra lorra fun   tractor    brmm brmm
I do not know why   I just love this game
very nice game
this game be       a step up from f     from graphic to gameplay   it be a very good and fun game    pro   good graphic fun gameplay easy install of   rd party mod   with almost every farming sim game   good map no need to manually set up steering wheel   con   none   this be all come from a pc user
very disappointed with this version so far   I purchase this version so I could finally use my g     with force feedback   sadly not only do ffb not work   some button do not work either   this be very poor from giant software and frustrating because I do enjoy the series   there be also bug and glitch that need work out and the devs be not great communicator   as it stand it s a negative for I unless a patch come    I m not hopeful though     beware if look to play fully with a wheel   especially the g   
I have nearly       hour play fs    and fs     this f    be great   why   read on      graphic   animation and visual be a solid improvement   dirt and mud effect be much more realistic   for example when plow   sound effect such as tractor engine be really improve   gearbox be a good addition   give player the option to use manual transmission   season cycle be well implement   nice to finally have this in base game   production line be a another thing that s great to have in the base game   more way to bring in revenue to your farm and more thing to do   there be additional step you can do to improve yield on field such as remove field stone and mulching   then   grape and olive be bloody wonderful to have and very different from traditional crop   I love the new option to buy use equipment   this be one of my favorite thing   this f    have more base game equipment then any of the other game do at release   ai worker be well and so be traffic on the road   so as you can see   there s a lot of farming goodness to like in fs    folk   final thought    two thumb up from I people   so if your a fan of the farming sim   just get this its great   watch some of the popular youtuber and see for yourself
I be expect this to be very similar to f    but boy be I wrong   the graphic in most area be improve but not cyberpunk like   while the game play be generally the same as fs    some new farming equipment have be add and new setting like dlss for the graphic which be always a bonus
if you play fs    you be go to like this one   graphic be just a tad well but not a big jump   I notice more feature have be add that add to the experience of be a sim which include some item which be mod previously be now just part of the game
love it   first time I play with the farming enterprice and I already enjoy it  
its a verry cool game to play with friend   but it can get boring if you play it alone
fun game
gud game
still no    seater vehicle in base game   really
I be honestly very disappointed in fs     I generally don t know how giant manage it but everytime they fail   they be the only game developer that can take a game that be playable to a game that be unplayable in a single patch    don t get I wrong I have put thousand of hour in the giant farm sim game over the year   since the late patch I be unable to play a single save game and keep it without the game decide I no long need it and automatically delete it for I    until they have fix the game I be unable to recommend a game that give you constant headache while try to enjoy the immersive experience that the game could provide
surprised at how relaxing and fun it be
gib alpacas     be it buggy   yes   do it have next to no tutorial information   yes   why be I still play it     idk     plez send help
perfect example for the horrible state of game release in           mp do not work at all   server crash all the time    no major new feature    lot of bug    visual and gameplay    bad map design    take    year of   development     waste       well   I really be get too old for this stuff
my review of farmsim    compare to farmsim     pro   well audio many great feature well multiplayer experience   con   no triple screen monitor support graphic   scenery and pattern in field texture poor optimisation and    fps lock still miss feature I e   in cab control   mirror seat adjustment   ability to move onscreen gui
if you like farm this be a fun game full of option
not a lot of instruction and key binding be a nightmare but graphic and once you know what you be do it be awesome
tractor go brrrrrr
mostly a re run of the last installment   as expect   if you like the previous iteration you ll enjoy this one   the ai worker be still dumb as rock though
I ve never meet a simulation game like this   farming simulator series   I mean to say   especially   fs      I strongly recommend it to you who be eager to play a real good game
very fun and highly enjoyable   the graphic be pretty much the same as f    except for the crop and soil   the crop and soil be now much more realistic and give much more emersion to the game   the sound be also amazing you can hear all kind of sound like the caff be spray out the back of your combine   a very fun game with some nice improvment from fs  
   I guess    connection to the server lose   check your internet connection and restart the game   simulator        would be a bit of a mouthful   though it d be more appropriate    edit   I guess that be just a bad weekend for the server right as I start play   otherwise its a good game
I think no game get boring fast than snowrunner   I be wrong    this game be like a void that suck your time and soul and give very little to nothing in return    the feeling of accomplishment be minimal yet you re suppose to do the same thing over and over again    time management be not very good either   after you have do everything that you need to do   ultimately you be only leave with    option   a   do contract   which involve do the same thing you always do   b   skip time   which you will do a lot    automation be also not very good   you re suppose to do everything on your own   and thing will be even more hectic once you grow big   yes   there be ai that could assist you   you could ask they to do your field   drive to somewhere   et cetera   but you still have to manage they yourself   it s not as automatic as say    euro truck simulator employee kind of automatic    so   all that s leave be the feeling of overwhelmed   and loneliness    of all proper simulator I ve play this one feel the most boring the fast truck sim   mechanic sim   construction sim   drive sim   etc   you may ask    of course you re suppose to do the same thing repeatedly   it s farm   in truck sim all you do be drive so what s so different or why not get bored with that     well at least in drive trucking sim   you will less likely to see the same scenery   and the feel of freedom be more apparent than this    in comparison this game make you feel like you re play truman or live in a springfield that s cover in a giant dome by epa or in chester s mill   I think this game be okay if you re an absolute farming geek or farming equipment enthusiast but for an average dude who seek for fun like I I would say you would not get a lot of it in this game   especially if you re do strictly singleplayer
the player base for game like this be relatively small as it s a rather specific genre   however   I have love these game since I first buy fs    on my xbox       giant software have make several improvement with this late installation of the franchise and   as both a long time player and a degree holder in the field   I can say that they have do a fantastic job try to replicate what can be a very arduous profession in a manner that be engage and fun while still have a level of educational value that most people be lack any sort of previous experience with   again   I realize the pool of individual that enjoy game like this be small   but from myself   I say well do
very enjoyable game        but here be the issue I have with it the unnecessary pay dlc s and these ridiculous season pass etc   massive issue with server host one moment find the server no prob and then next day nothing change noone can find the server even after restart etc   even with dedicated server    feel like the lack of care for its player base be a bit show
recommend by    of     only farmer
gud farming game even though the ai worker be moronic
as with all the other iteration   this be great entertainment and the hour wizz by as you learn the rope   much well with friend    especially when you re mess about instead of plant
tractor go vroom   very cool        potato very round
  it just work   ai turn around in the middle of field and   job do   ai    time out of     will get stick on a simple transporting mission   drive onto lamp post   railroadcrossing have invisible wall   most of equipment will get stick all this on original map and original equipment   I wonder   how modder can make ai work as a charm and developer can t   roe deer run on water and through equipment crow fly almost straight into air   still seem more of a scam than a simulator game
bug simulator     this game have so many bug and sadly I ve past the refund steam limit   I really want to like this game   but I find myself have to restart the game over and over just to unload grass for example   I ve be play since fs    and never see it this bad before   do not buy this game at full price   period
urgh   this be so frustrating   I ve pay for a a game version that have improvement that be free mod in fs    and the graphic and physics be still from     year ago    I be happy that the modder responsible for some of the good modsin f    have be employ to add they to the base game   and get hopefully some credit and payment   but really it be hardly any well than a fs    version with all the great effort of modder add to make it half decent   I love this game   but I will probably have to do what have always be the case   play fs    for another year or so until the fantastic modder have do some decent map   add some gameplay and graphic tweak and some more interesting equipment etc     all the while hope some other software house publisher will dive in and create a more immersive   less clunky and more contemporary farming simulator   I hate to say that   giant have try to develop the game   and sadly it be still probably the good farming simulator   but with today s hardware software   on pc and console   the whole game should be so much well   farming be a critical industry   and the following for this game be so loyal   I just feel that if giant can not make the investment need to bring the whole thing up to date   then someone else should   this be just another miss opportunity from a conservative and unimaginative software house publisher
so    negative review    first of all if you think this would be a complete new game you be wrong   this be tweak fs      I like the game but the bug be plenty and it be not worth its price for what it be and what it give you   sure I love the new factory and grape but the graphic aren t change much   the field texture   when you cultivate it have a after harvest texture     the graphic bug that give you    fps but you move the camera you get     the multiplayer bug already from the first day where it do not work for all and its still not fix after    day    it be over price   if you can buy it for less than     euro buy it but if you do not want to get mad and waste your money do not buy it    I feel like all game devs nowadays be just make       game and overprice and do not care about the customer at all    overall I like this game but its overpriced      update after     h of playtime   you will still buy it because its the new game and all the mod and everything be make for it but I be disgust by these greedy devs who hype the player so much and lie about their new game which be not new   they be just improve version of the old one   since fs    nothing much change apart from new feature which be already add via mod in fs     I hope fs    will be as they say and I hope it will not have a bad buggy start as do fs   
oh geeze   where to start     be play fs since        nice incremental improvement in       and then in        but I m underwhelme   especially consider that fs      have be full price   and more than previous release   for almost a year before the first sale   when I say   full price    I mean close to aaa game   fs be not a aaa title   and bad   there s still plenty of add on content to purchase to get everything   such as   platinum edition   which doesn t include year    season   year    season   etc     ok   anyways   let s get behind pricing and value   bang for your buck     caseih have be mostly nerfe in fs       it s probably not the only brand but the most noticeable for I come from fs      I get that john deere be the new hot commodity     and I suspect that the licensing deal be part of the explanation for increase pricing     but come on   do we really have to make it this obvious   several caseih model be miss and some that be in the game be almost a joke   it s almost like each release of farm sim be now go to be theme around a specific brand   be that really the way to go   lol   no   because it s just not right    ok   so some be think I m a brand loyalist at this point   let I really get into the nitty gritty now        pro       run well on ryzen       series   almost no cpu utilization   and radeon rx       xt   about      utilization at      p       hz   max setting    dx    introduction new for fs    be nice     almost introduce a problem where it s too gpu bind and not enough cpu bind   lol   not complain here though     ty devs   not sure where vulkan stand though      crop season   raw variety of different equipment to purchase   and great native mod support be definitely win     multiplayer be nice     even if it have a lot of room for improvement   I elaborate on this later     physics seem to have improve   though it s still not like that find in snowrunner and some other sim excellent off road physics game    add    jun       I m generally enjoy the game enough to continue log hour on it   so it s not all doom and gloom   lol   I do have to recover an auto save game after my son sell a bunch of my equipment for some other   fun stuff   that wasn t really practical     anyways   my point be that I appreciate that relatively robust save game system   the wife have be play sim    for like     year and still no auto save   lmao        con        caseih and other brand be nerfed or less model available in favor of john deere    only four map   really      rolling can t be turn off   not a common thing in the u s   midwest so kind of odd       limited number of online radio station   why can t this be more easily customize      bush be hard to get rid of     paint ground texture   grass   gravel   etc    be the only guarantee bet but cost money    landscaping be expensive     edit    jun        idea   should be able to simulate change and then choose to commit or discard    the economy on medium difficulty be a bit expensive for equipment repair   degrade condition too fast   and crop pay a bit low even with near       yield bonus which take a lot of time to achieve such yield    edit    jun        I also realize that passive income like animal   solar   etc   be a smart way to boost earning   but either grain sale pay a little too low or maintenance cost deteriation speed be too aggressive    contract job pay low   especially when use one s own equipment   after factor fuel and repair   and for certain job type    contract job seem to get stick     e g   baling and other that   edit   take a long time to move on unless you complete they or at least start they and purposely fail they    having ai operate one s equipment be too expensive unless the very large tractor   harvester   implement   etc   be use   and even then profit margin be still questionable    variety of side by side and farm truck be laughable     modde truck provide a way well value and more worthwhile   even for user try to be   ultra realistic      multiplayer should have an option for   realistic   vs    arcade   whereas realistic mean player don t ignore equipment box   fall inside and thru tractor   etc    while arcade be the current style   player of equipment they aren t drive around bind to there dimension and therefore   fall right through     multiplayer should have a manual or automatic refresh option   my friend will create a game   but if I join too early   it doesn t show and win t ever show until I back all the way back out and go into   multiplayer       join game   again    similar to equipment condition   paint condition degrade waaayyyy too quickly   even for equipment that be store under a shed or whatever with a roof and be properly maintain    there should be some kind of system for discount   special   etc   on seed   fertilizer   and other typically palletize bag product     still no tractor cab door and window that can t be open unless its modde   sad time     almost all manual and powershift transmission be go in tractor     b s    this relate back to the fact that some brand don t have model from             year ago   how about we have a   use market   for old equipment model   not every farmer wish to purchase a brand new     hour tractor     map need to get big   semi truck and other fast vehicle can get from one side to another in no time   maybe variable map size need to at least become an option the future   with high end system able to play on those large map size   talk stock   not just modde     no ability to control leave right brake pedal   diff lock   and   wd vs    wd on capable tractor    tractor with cvt           still seem to rev high even when engine load be very low   edit    jun       not enough powershift or other manual semi manual            I think this also reflect that there should be more old model tractor in the game as many farmer turn to the use market   buying        year old tractor in the u s   be a very common practice    house   shed   etc   don t overcome chop down tree   result in some weird foundation and auto landscaping effect   their placement should either require complete elimation of tree and stump or just raise the price of installation and automatically include the removal   my preference but maybe this could be a set      loan should have more detail to they   e g   line of credit   similar to how it s down now on a monthly basis in small    k increment   with more formal loan in large allotment offer more specific pay off and interest term    ability to buy other farm house   shed   etc   on property that be purchase    the high pressure washer isn t mobile and cost    k   really   edit   add      npc traffic like to turn right in front of you   cause a crash   even when one s own speed be constant   I e   they should be able to calculate and predict if they should wait to turn or go ahead and make the turn   they be aggressive driver as it currently stand   edit   add      when you purchase a dog   he she run in slow motion   it literally have I and my son laugh out loud   otherwise   it s a nice touch and fun to play ball with he her      edit   add   on    jun       would really like to frame rate limit natively build in    this may start to sound like a rant but when you charge near aaa pricing for a game   one expect near aaa feature and such   furthermore   detailed feedback be how I believe the most important   juicy change will come about   not high level crabbing and moan   all these con take away my enjoyment from this game   add up in such a way that either have I not want to play anymore or at time think   man   fs     be go to be a real money grab   huh   guess I win t touch fs anymore    nothing against the gaming business model of have dlc to add content and increase margin but a game like the fs franchise can t charge both a high entry cost for the base game and ton in add ons dlc s and such
anyone say that his be a good game right now be either pay or a fanboy   anyone with a brain can see that this be just dissapointe   bug be all over the place   game be barely work and no patch for a week   only patch be for macos and they be not even a gaming platform     be it a trend now to release game to only make money and not a good gameplay   what happen to you giant    and a bonus   with a    year pass you still have to pay for first two release dlcs   which be a tractor and a truck that should be in a base game
I get horsee in the back like a farmer
really good game much well than the last one it doesn t just feel like a reskin of the last f it feel      time well
h
start play this game with my brother in        and still have a good time
the game have be out for    day and friend be still not able to join my multiplayer game   even with port forwarding do   no communication from the developer either      it have be fix a while ago
  lk olarak smorgasbork taraf ndan g nderildi   we currently have no patch timeline release   of course you don t   just like you have no qa tester for the game   it s painfully obvious   how do something like this farming simulator      farming simulator     ekran g r not s   g nderen   force finish   get past qa   easy   there wasn t one   I ve have play every fs game since     and this be by far the bad one I ve see since   there be so many bug the game be literally not playable at time   weather it be a contract not work properly   a vehicle not be able to reverse   ui bug   controller issue   performance issue   mp server issue   ai issue   sound issue   I mean the list go on and on   there be no way   you have qa   some of the issue be so minor they should have be fix quickly and easily   put out a product in this condition do nothing but put a scar on your reputation as a company   think about that   because I definitely will not be buy the next one   I ve do the same with electronic art anthem and square enix after marvel avenger   if you as a company be keen to put out such a poor product for people hard earn money   it just show how much you care for customer   you know   the one that provide you with the money to continue your work   talk about bite the hand that feed you

farm game go brrrrrr
this game rely heavily on ai worker tend your field while you re off tend more field   there be a glitch that will prevent you from hire ai worker   for the game to have a glitch like this   on it s fourth iteration   on a mechanic so important to progression   be downright atrocious   the fact that someone go above and beyond to make a mod to fix what the devs fall short on   be a perfect example of a game company milk the cash cow   honestly   how do you release a game    time   farming simulator            and still have the same bug   this game and it s devs honestly feel like they be milk a cash cow   they find a basic product that they can sale and other can fix   really wish I hadn t pay for it   let alone rent a server for a buddy and I
awesome game that can keep you busy for hour on end   great franchise with ton of community content and intervention from giant include the amazing graphic and lot to do   what else could you ask for
m quinas agr colas
its a good game   can not wait for the next one
cool farming chill game
u can farm
this be a very relaxing game full of different processing unit and ton of plant   they have an amazing community of modder   content creator   and friendly helpful people  
I get that this be for a very specific audience   but it take some serious stupidity to advertise a game as multiplayer and not have a properly function multiplayer for    year   refund
farming simulator     and     be great   I learn on fs      it s a good place to start   f    have additional setting in the game   such as snow   season and so on   but you can turn those off if you wish   I like the mod you can bring into the game   and be look forward to fs     what I like about the game be the quality of the graphic   the animation of the machinery and animation of the animal   no pixelate graphic in this game   I highly recommend if you be search for a simulated game
it be not that I do not like the game   problem be   I can not consider it a game   game in general present challenge reward system   create obstacle for you to overcome and reward you for do so    in fs     there be no obstacle per say   you know from start   how much crop you get from the harvest   how much money you get for the crop in what month   there be no random event present challenge like crop be damage by storm or some infection   cattle die from illness   very hard winter   the machine do not even randomly break down and the tear wear in the game be not have any actual impact   everything be linear and stable   you know   that from this field   that take can   h to prepare   after one year you get x of crop and y dollar of revenue   the same for      year onward   all that while the economic of the game do not present much challenge and I would dare to say   if you do not do complete nonsense   it be impossible to fail game    you could say   that in other game it be the same   if you act normally   you can not lose either   but in other game you could lose a match   die   until next reload    you to some extent do not know   what to expect   and when you know   it be usually bore grind game   that nobody play     so why     hr of playtime   I be try to fiddle with the game via mod   try to make it   a game    but the mod I find eventually do not change the core mechanic of the game enough so to make it last fun   thus most of the     h be simply plot a course via courseplay   I leave the pc run and do something else   while the ai spend hour and hour by plow   roll   pick stone etc     I see a video on yt   that this game can be perceive as simulation of drive the different machine   support the sale of these in the real life   therefore also dlcs be basically new machine from same or different manufacture   and I do agree   if I would have a gaming steering wheel and nice music track   I can imagine it be actually kind of relax and satisfactory   yt image    but than I would put it into the same category as yoga   meditation etc   positive thing   but not     game    I do not regret the time invest   this   game do somehow scratch an itch I do not know I have   will still look for mod   that may bring the variability and challenge to the game   but until that happen  
livestock work have become simple   the detail have disappear   the stable don t need water   the floor don t fill with sh it   they eliminate at least two job   maybe I like carry water to the barn and clean the dirt on the floor   brother   animal drink water by imagine it   and if you don t build a manure silo   animal win t sh it    still   the game be good   but we need more polish mode   I like work with small equipment   my most powerful tractor be      hp and my wide implement be    meter   I be wait for more small and useful polish building
it take a bit of time to get into gear with farming simulator      but now I m enjoy the game   I come from american truck simulator and euro truck simulator     which I still love    at first   I be overwhelm by the game   I didn t know where to start   unfortunately   the guide tour in game didn t help much   but after watch some   professional   play on youtube   like hilmi   ahin   I get my bearing and get to work   so   don t give up on f    at first   it s worth the effort
good
a lot to do
I sell my wife for tractor
fun
      I would recommend this game to anyone   I have be a farming simulator fan since fs    come out   great game if you just wanna relax and destress

      hour isn t enough   edit        hour still isn t enough
   what great game to play with my girlfriend I want to take little break from the fps market hop on this game be relax and lot of enjoyment out of it great game I would totally recommencement it
my honest review of the game     back story   I have be play farming simulator since before it join steam   fs                        and now      it have progress tremendously over its life especially from its very beginning   its awesome world wide modding community make the game fun and then they be incorporate into the next gen of the game   I have enjoy watch the game expand and add wood   animal   and whole new line of crop   I especially like the use of real machinery that I see roll down the road of my home area   my kid even comment on it    isn t that the harvester you use in your game dad    its fun to see how these thing can really impact our world   the good    amazing modding community   incorporation of mod into next generation game   new crop line to harvest   real world machinery   great map to explore   go to feature for worker to move equipment   new construction page be nice   since fs    come out I have notice a lot more nickle and diming of the community then be past generation   even if you go to the giant software site for the farming simulator franchise you will notice how most of the addition to game be mod that add value to the base game   then they start come out with platinum addition   this I be ok with   you can buy the base game if you just want to play but if you want the extended content you would purchase the next level platinum expansion   I do this every time until fs     now the platinum be just another dlc jumble into their season pass   I really enjoy the game but when I have to pay and additional      for season pass dlc that should be incorporate into the game it make I hesitate and ask myself      be it worth it    unfortunately at this time I can t say yes   the bad    ask to much for dlc that doesn t add much to the game   the grind of working be f    to make money be bad then previous gen   the landscape tool be still not the good but an improvement from fs     forestry still need some work   can s remove some object to clear path for large field    overall   I still say that fs    be a good game to play   I do recommend it and I think its a good addition to the franchise   please spend your money responsibly and I see you out in the field
I have live on the farm since       I like farmer and game about the farm and I recommend this game
farm
   day       hour
unrealistic dirt   no worn tire   unrealistic tractor smoke from the muffer   little damage to the tractor part
great
game be buggy as hell   literally game breaking bug where the ground just go black while I m farm   I can not see what I m do     edit   still buggy as hell
the successor to fs    have prove to be a addition to the farming simulator series   with the layer of production it add a whole new level of gameplay
hej
vrey enjoyable
I like taste good
very fun   I be farmer
great game to play with friend and solo   very relax
I love farming and if you like it too you ll love this game
   this be a fun relax game   I would recommend to all people   I get this for christmas and so far it be good
e blana de urs
it be very satisfying   and when your bored just start a new save you can landscape ramp and drive tractor off it or use the atv and do cool stuff   never think I would enjoy farming simulator well here we be      
I can t really say anything but just that it be amazing   good job giant
it s a large variety of farming   realistically   if you think you d like that   get it
great game for the price
great game to play at your own pace   I personally love play in real time without mod and be really enjoy it   you can play at a fast pace with or without mod too   well optimize for streamer   graphic be beautiful   and overall great quality
I when zonk zonk on le tractor   like I when be I right gamer   such gaming   such farming   much experience   absolute jucier
     hour play in farming simulator     in three year        hour play in farming simulator     in     day   need I say more
good
well than its predecessor   but still far from be an acceptable simulator    pro   production chain of the various product   with colorful and easy to understand icon   dlss   although not very functional    a decent number of vehicle   even detailed one   well management of the ai   it can be give simple command such as   go there     sow field      etc       in the shop there be category   or package    this mean that if you want to take care of forestry   just click on the right icon and a list of vehicle and tool suitable for that job will appear   character customization   not really necessary   needless to say   but it s a nice feature     mid   change of season and crop that must be work only in the right season   processing of olive and grape   now   why do I put these feature in mid and not pro   well simply because these be community develop mod for farming       and they be free   so   you can play fs        download the season mod   the mod that add more crop and bam     you will have fs         it s a little angry that you have to pay       for feature that be free and for idea develop not by the software house but by the community                    it be currently far from be a great game   it be limit to be decent and well only than its predecessor   nothing else   but be careful   it do not mean that it be bad   rather it be a good game   unfortunately it be      similar to the previous chapter and not worth the full price for a copy paste
       relaxing and fun with friend
a lot well than     
so I m go to try my good I play since farming simulator       I become a farmer because of the game I find friend through the series and so on    but I m angry I don t understand why only I    the game be half finish a lot of thing just don t work full with bug etc basically this game be like a good mode f    they just put the community mod in to the game and release it for     buck I think nobody test this game before the release    they say the building mode be refurbish but it be the same the pallet stick in to the ground we still don t have work camera in the machine or real mirror or dynamic ground or guidance steering    they don t even put time to write some proper instruction for the game mechanic      the developer just want money nothing more don t care about the community behind the game      but without we they be just poor piece of g       just look at the claas tractor its the same indoor texture as in fs          they do nothing with it just nothing       and I can tell the problem all day      break server etc      do not buy it    buy f    download some mod and that be the same game like f      have a nince day  
I ve be a fan of the series and have spend countless hour in the previous game   but be get bore of issue I be hope   would get improve in the next game   but I be dissapointe    the drive phisic be still         bale and pallet phisic have not be improve in my oppinion have         bad     the graphic have almost not be improve at all in    year of develpment time     the game at its current state   have get a lot of small aswell as gamebrake bug    the game still have bad optimization   all in all the game be just f     with slight improvement and feature wich mostly be avaliable as mod before   the game be just not worth     euro
only play the singleplayer until now and also only one of the three map available   no mod other than those publish by giant themselves      gameplay feel clunky from time to time   especially if ai be involve     ai helper be as useful    useless as before   they need constant attention   especially if the field they re work on aren t perfectly square or there be tree near the edge     ai vehicle be still like rock and don t care if the player be near they or not     season change the way you have to play the game   even if you have seasonal growth disabled     season always affect the amount and    type of task you can accept to make some   quick   money      production chain and new crop type seem cool but I haven t have the time to look at they yet   this will most likely add more depth to the game     game run smooth   have no major crash hiccup     graphic and sound be good but not outstandingly good     overall it s a solid game and a slight improvement over the last f     I ve you ve play f    with a lot of mod and you re ok with it don t buy f     just   yet   this game need some more polish   if you want to enjoy the late and possibly great fs so far then go for it but expect some frustration here and there    I would rate this game a        more or less fulfill my expectation   mod will most likely improve the gameplay over time as have happen with the old farming sim as well
very relaxing and fum to kick back with some friend and play
great game   I be a bit sceptical at first but now I m in love with it   would definitely recommend this
its like farming but farming
       they keep the doghouse
banger tracktor go brrr
the good of the series   check it   and you will be convince
very good   very detailed   be able to use my steering wheel and farm sim side panel with no configuration   awesome
good game
   the game be a step up from f    but if you don t care about the graphic and just want a fun farming game to play get fs     the only thing that really change be brand   model   and crop other than that not really anything new   most thing in f    like the new ai driver could be do in f    with a mod call auto drive
I like the game so far   with friend its even well   find a bug or two hopefully it will be repair in next patch   mostly which other people be post   love the graphic and optimization so far    unfortunatly I have to change my review to negative       reason be multiplayer   most of the time you will get a message   can not connect to server    especially during weekend and evening      I mean I can tolerate bug and error    hopefully they will be repair     but I hate company which do not want to invest in their server so everyone can play the game when they want to play it     we all pay for your game   most of people here pay even more for dedicated server and now we cannnot play    this game be       and boring if you do not play it with friend     at least for I       you receive a lot of money and we expect at least that you reinvest some of that money in more server so we can all play    edit    after patch multiplayer be good and we all enjoy the game   there be bug but if you like this type of game you will enjoy it   have not try new expansion yet but I will for sure
this game be fantastic and certainly       well than f     I realise there be bug in the game but it be also a work in progress so you have to expect a few bug   the graphic be brilliant and I be run everything at ultra high with     fps continuously which be a vast improvement on fs     I know there have be a lot of negative comment about     but that be just come from people who expect a game to be perfect   no game be       perfect when it be release
this game have glitch here and there but overall it run great   I d recommend this game
last time they add deere    this time they add deer    it s like a whole new game
the game be so fun
I haven t sleep for a week   farming be love   farming be life
its like buy a brand new vehicle from that dealer that will not even start and you have to cab home   I ll try again when they fix what shouldn t be a problem after    year of work on this   disappoint
it be still rough around the edge    control for the crane can be frustrating    refining be require   physics be unique in you can launch item into space willie nillie   
one of my favorite game   always fun   major improvement from fs  
good follow up to fs     pretty good even without all the mod    pro    awesome building system   lot more varied activity   grape and olive   production chain   vastly improve worker   con    no breast physics
for full game and the need platinum edition   its about     buck cad   before taxis    and that just to unlock thing like log    and the new mining    I think    log be in      not an add feature    sure that a big    I    to the loyal fan    or you can buy platinum    premium edition for for over         cad all this before tax and conversion to usd    basically the game publisher devs have go ea sport mode and have decide its time to crank the money grab machine to         and screw the loyal fan   and new player alike    refunded product as I can t even begin to encourage this bs anymore  
first of all I must say I really enjoy the game   but I must give a negative review for one reason alone   why on earth can t I run a dedicated server on my pc     I mean the tool be there and its work fine   but I can not run the game if the server be on   I need another pc and another game license for that   I play many multiplayer game and I usually run a dedicated server so I can play with my friend without have the host online all the time and I never encounter this problem in any of they
if you re a fan of the series then you ll most likely enjoy this new game   I play a few hour and I d say its worth to buy
I have autism
       would farm again
good
bset game ever
   amazing product
my roommate and I get in an argument over this game   he say I could get pay to do this and that this be dumb   I continue to drink beer and farm   he ll never understand       
good game just stressful in multiplayer
haha tractor go brrr
very good game with incredible graphic   can t wait for farming simulator     in november   graphic       could use some work physics       mod support        the game wouldn t be as fun without they difficulty       very easy to play once you get the hang of it overall rating       very good game
yes
game will not let I play
there be far   far to many glitch and bug and thing just not work right in multiplayer for this to be a recommend
this new game be very good love it nice job gay
its good game I play
whole lotta stroh
patience distil   not bug free   but what fun would that be   plenty of doodad and thingamawhatsit   and whatever s lack be find in the workshop   well with friend   but I hope they re also bore
do you like your game play in slide show unoptimized mode   do you like constant bug   do you like open menus that do not even play correctly   and all at a outrageous cost   then do I have the game for you        if that s what you re after   no seriously its really that bad   come back to this game to hopefully change my review and it still stand more than ever   this game be the most unoptimized pos of a game I have play in a long long time   do not waste your money or even time if you get it for free   you should be pay to play this game   third edit   take    year but the game finally run
after fs     this seem like very good upgrade   production system be great   I only wish it s more in depth   for instance   that we can see production step by step   but overall okay     d depth   or however they call new type of texture of ground be awesome   really put game graphic on another level   map be awesome too   I prefer erlengrat because of its narrow road and small city that put some life into game   american one be cool   but not my type   hovewer   haut beyleron map be too small for I   that s just my opinion   for vehicle and gearbox build in and season   game be fantastic   you almost don t need any mod   there be such a long list of vehicle and tool that it s mindblowe   I m glad giant put old vehicle in game too   overall rating of the game I d give        not        because it start to feel after     hour like it s f    with mod     but I love it and don t regret buy it at all   can not wait to see more mod for this relax game
this game be all about multiplayer   host a server to play with your friend be near impossible   you can t connect to an ip adre   there be no way to filter to your friend server   you just have to hope it find it way into the      k server its select for you
in my experience with fs    I wouldn t recommend this for people with a low to medium range pc s or who own fs     the overall experience with try to find the optimal setting be a pain   most of the time I play the game be try to figure out how to make it run decent enough to play   I run a ryzen      x with a       xt   ik not the good card to have   be in a pinch to upgrade my    y o graphic card    and after all that effort it end look like complete garbage to keep up a stable     fps with constant dip down to     fps   I can get onto fs    run medium to high setting with no fps dip with the same setup for what   one or two thing I can just mod into        honestly if you own fs    keep your money its not worth it
fs     great game overall   a big difference compare to fs     do not listen to the people say its a waste of money and its buggy etc   sure enough its buggy   but what game isn t now aday and directly after launch too   the whole content thing people be mention be kinda bs   production   new texture   new sound   optimization for low end pc and alot more new content   and do not say the whole thing like    that exist in fs    too     sure enough   all thos thing exist in f     but after like     mod download   this be base game folk   base game   not include the big modding community for this game and with this we be go to have ton of mod in just a month or so   if you have play any f before and like it   this be a winner
the multiplayer doesn t work
tere
its life yo
nice
nice update to a long running series   look forward to see what come with mod and dlc
good game
I ve always be a big lover of this game   but the new sound be simply so good
much well than f    the new giant engine    have drastically improve the graphic and gameplay   additionally the ai worker system have be significantly improve however there be still some bug when the worker miss area when sow
wait for a few major update fix   for now I d just stick to fs     until they can work these bug and flaw out
cool     
local multiplayer be trash and the server pause to   sync player   be just dumb   this be       we aren t in the old age anymore   no star review for I
love          my cousin while watch my tractor plant some cotton    thumb up on this game  
good fun with friend   need more animal   but other then that I have greatly enjoy it thus far
great game
mmmm veery good
good farming game and truck game
a lot well then fs     good to see they add alot of mod from f    into the base game   downside be play with friend on a dedi server you can not sell straight to they and be a       fight try to get do stuff together   game be much well play with friend
be there any negative thing about the farming game   I do not think so   its great   just a chill game and fun with some friend   do not play alone though   that can be pretty lonely and boring tbh     the game have some performance issue   even on high end system   right after you join a map   let it sit for    minute and let it load in the asset before play   you might wanna switch between your vehicle   turn off and on the light a few time   that fix alot of the stutter
world good game
""
the mod make this game
my new favorite since ff     I haven t play the other   I highly recommend if you have the calling for farming   cowcool
nice
good fun so far   generally the same as the previous game but with some very welcome addition   be able to get the ai to drive across the map and deliver good for you be incredibly useful   as well as the greenhouse   production line and other new stuff
I have previously go back to a bagged vacuum after my first canister vac prove to be a disaster to clean   it seem to clog with hair with each use   and I have to wash filter out constantly   I take a chance   and buy this vacuum   it be build different than the old model and can collect more hair than I think without lose suction   while I do need to empty it fairly frequently   I can at least see enough inside the clear collection container to know when to do so   empty it be easy   and while I do need to take the canister apart after a few use to knock off dust accumulation   I m not rinse filter out that often   currently rinse out after    use    and the filter isn t really get that dirty    on another note   the weight of the vacuum be somehow list at over     lbs   I believe that be an error and be a   shipping   weight   with box and packaging figure in    the weight of the vacuum be around     lbs   and push nicely on the floor   don t worry about the weight if you be get this for pet hair
I generally have love this series   I ve play every one from        up to this one   so far the good one have be fs      yes   that s right   farming simulator      be    will be for a long time the good one     I don t know how many hour I ll put into this version   as it s simply not as good as     be   I would also urge other to buy      instead of this one     with this version   full emphasis be throw into the season s system   which use to be a mod in      now I never really care for the season system   I just want to play    have fun    this version incorporate that system   and everything be tie to it   even if you turn it off   the crop    time be still tie into that system   which I find plainly just complete rubbish    so far   I ve play this a lot   but I find   while in     I could literally play it for week   I can only play this version for a few hour   then I get totally bored of it    mainly   because I have to sleep through day month   just for my crop to grow     I feel like they may have add new stuff   but they mess it up from the fantastic game it be   I pre order fs     this one   not only do I wait for a sale   I actually get it from a completely different source   at half the price it be new   as I didn t wanna pay the full      for such a piece of crap     it s just boring to play   they add more crap for you to do   like mulch   that nobody do   as it s not worth the time or effort    they still have the weed system   which even in     nobody use   because it be buggy as hell   and they don t use it in this version either     I can t       put my finger on it   but    it s just not as good as        so    do I recommend this     no    do I still recommend       sure     edit   try to write this review   the game wouldn t let I post it   I have to write a different one   then edit it to my original    interesting censorship there   
game itself be amazing however how they do season pass be unacceptable   you have to buy both the game   season pass and dlc s that s release to milk more money of we instead of be honest and actually include the dlc in their season pass like how it s mean to be    and so this get s my negative review as well
when I buy fs     it be mostly as a joke and I never think I d actually enjoy it   let alone that it d become the main game I play   that be    year ago and nowadays I ve become interested in real life agriculture and I m even explore related career   I can t imagine a game I enjoy more than f  
its not anything different from the       one   I think the ai driving would be well and go around thing but instead it just sit their wonder why there be a light poll in the way
work like a dream on steam deck    low a few of the graphic setting in game and lock at    fps and you still get a good look   smooth run gaming experience    of all time for favourite game
the development on this game and the mod support be mint   continually evolve   look fantastic   your imagination be the limit to what it give back    I ll just finish this field     hour later        lol
farming and chill   farming and chill x   in coop
game will not launch after first install   uninstalled and re instal on    different drive get the same result it will not launch
there be some issue with the game but I hope they sort out they    but its kind a fun gmae  
not worth it at the moment   its a copy of fs    with the season mod   helper be still stupid
fun mix of strategy   organisation and skill   survive the first    year without cheat and consider yourself an accomplished farmer
the game ok but try to join a friend in this game be terrible my friend will start a world then I have to sit there for about     minute wait for it to actually show up on the server list also it s not worth the ask price
      graphic         you forget what reality be    beautiful    good    decent    bad    don t look too long at it    ms do        gameplay         very good    good    it s just gameplay    mehh    watch paint dry instead    just don t        audio         eargasm    very good    good    not too bad    bad    I m now deaf        audience         kid    teen    adult    grandma        pc requirement         check if you can run paint    potato    decent    fast    rich boi    ask nasa if they have a spare computer        game size         floppy disk    old fashioned    workable    big    will eat      of your   tb hard drive    you will want an entire hard drive to hold it    you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the datum        difficulty         just press   w     easy    easy to learn    hard to master    significant brain usage    difficult    dark soul        grind         nothing to grind    only if u care about leaderboard rank    isn t necessary to progress    average grind level    too much grind    you ll need a second life for grind        story         no story    some lore    average    good    lovely    it ll replace your life        game time         long enough for a cup of coffee    short    average    long    to infinity and beyond        price         it s free     worth the price    if it s on sale    if u have some spare money leave    not recommend    you could also just burn your money        bug         never hear of    minor bug    can get annoying    ark   survival evolve    the game itself be a big terrarium for bug                                                           
because                
I love this game but its always a headache try to play multiplayer with my kiddo either it will not find the game or it will not connect next day it will work under same set its so hit and miss
good game   
ok    hour in   this game be very new to I as be use a drive wheel   I putter around with the tutorial for a new player I find it a little overwhelming   then the power tool mod come out   so   I buy a large woodland   a pickup truck   flatbe trailer and a chainsaw   set my money to       and go off and start log   I love this aspect   I ll cut more tree   do some contract and work my way up   learn as I go   I almost wish someone would make that start a mod   force you to learn as you go    log and contract out until you can clear enough land to make your own field   now that I be do this I be love this game
they have eventually fix it   it now support ultra wide screen   but its now only week away from        just in time before fs     which I will definitely not be get    october            and this still can not be play on my basic pc I         f   rtx          gb ram   window    pro     bit monitor be a samsung            x       I be still have more fun on fs        fps as fs    can not handle ultra wide screen    as of march          it be no long playable when they do the last update   unable to roll back as they have remove ultra wide screen    some have have success by delete the cash   I be    of the many that this do not help   look forward to the fix   or look for a refund    be it really worth update   not really   there be so many mode for     it feel well run well    you know this company have give up when the dlc be available the same day its release    stick with     and grab all the free mod that will make     much well than     and save your money for something much well
great game once you no what you be do great tip on youtube

I play a map that be suppose to have a tutorial   and start I off with some basic machine   and such   nope   no tutorial   just the help menu    and no machine   there be a big float    that when I get close to it   take I in to the help   which say I should be able to see filter on the map   nope   no key to toggle any filter   I can only make the map big and small    in other word   nothing in the game work like the in game help say it do   oh   sure the graphic be nice   but there s nothing here to get you start   waste an hour with this   nothing show how on earth I m suppose to get start with anything   other than make my character look like a farmer    getting refund
I win t recommend this game in it s current state   honestly   I still feel f    be well   the lack of challenge be still an issue   it still feel arcade and too bright    new in it s design   still lack proper use vehicle   production be all lock   which make they pointless in a server   as you can t share production   it feel like they add all these single player feature to a game which in       should be embrace the online world   I feel it have step backwards and hasn t advance in anyway   animal be too restrictive   fs    be great with the animal actually roam field   but now we be in a game where everything have be dumbe down   nothing feel farm like and no real improvement   just take what modder have do and add it too the game
can not eat the cow
if the multiplayer would work I d consider think about a positive review    small update   it still doesn t work   good job
the network game be not think out   to connect to a friend you need to sell your soul to the devil

farming be cool
farming simulator     be an awesome farming game that everyone should play if you be into farming or just look to have fun and explore farming this game be for you
this game be a bug ridden mess   there be bug involve bunker silo that have literally be port into each version of this game since        this game be not worth      for how braindead and lazy the devs be   they never respond to bug in any forum   the wiki be barren
the graphic be great   the only thing that be mind boggle about the graphic be why the render distance be so low    copy paste free dlcs from previous game that they be now charge for   and they re all free if you do enough dig on modhub    trash devs   do not buy any of their game or dlcs
first of all   I like the game   I kinda enjoy it and it be good and would purchase it again   the thumb down be there to be hear   to show dissatisfaction    tl dr        the traffic be so horrible   I play with the thought of disable traffic      biogasplant be useless      everything be   balanced   income wise to a point where most thing don t even make sense run profit wise      f    feel like fs        the build menu and how landscaping work be horrible      pesky tooltip tell you what to do   even if it increase yield by measly              this game have no tooltip   short explanation or the like   you get throw in cold water      design aspect don t make sense or be plain wrong   to tell more about the point that nag I        the ai be horribly dumb   that even mere car in traffic be unmovable   why   probably because the pathfinding would literally screw everything up   what pathfinde   oh    y know    if you tell the dumb bot   drive here   they behave like a laser ride missile   they have a center line and go leave until the be over bound of their pathline and then they go hard right until it all continue   they drive like drunkenmaster   it s unbelievably bad   also the worker stil struggle with field that be not rectangular   since when be that   ls           the stock biogasplant be useless   the small one be not worth the hefty price that get ask   the medium one be   okay ish   and the large one be impossible to run unless you probably own half the field on most map and enjoy spend for freetime run out of silage constantly   iam use the modular biogasplant mod what do an insanely good joob on make it worthwhile   but not overpower       I own a sawmill that produce plank   I own a carpentry that produce furniture   I can sell furniture for        more than a pallete of plank   my sawmill do       cycle a month while my carpentry produce       if you supply wood and plank   you actually wait a whole year to get a trail fill and sell once for        more per pallete   this be so unprofitable   that I sell the carpentry and exclusively run the sawmill        I don t feel like anything improve   log be still a pain in the cunning lingual   dump silage and the like still feel like use the same physics system and yea     doesn t feel like an improvement       want to build something   yea   you need to level it first   if you place it   it s scuff up   level the ground before placement   yea   now your building or garage have a scuff up hill or ditch infront where you drive   oh   you can t edit it unless you delete the building because hitboxe be like barn    pun intend   it s utter        trust I       but for that I buy a roller for the field and need another pass     for           I have a life and will not do that   so I don t even care   why they do it   beyond I        so you have tooltip for stuff like that   but short description of implement in the shop   no you don t have it   feel free to discover what the tool can do and what they can t by yourself   have fun   thank you for useless tooltip and no tooltip where I d need em   yes there be a help menu   but it tell you only how thing be do   not what implement can do      woooow       so you can buy a huge tank of liquid fertilizer in a square drum   we use that drum to store rainwater for plant here and no   you can fit more than a mere       liter in those   they easily fit              liter depend on the size   so you buy a pallete of silage additive   when you get     liter remain   the weight be still     kg   so you want to tell I   a pallete weight     kg   what a joke
this game have crash on I at least around     time with under    hour of gameplay time    it be unplayable for that reason alone but also the ai worker be beyond bad in this farming simulator   they crash into everything and just give up   there be no fun in this game   just frustration
not enough of a tutorial to teach how to play the game for newcomer to the series
absolute buggy piece of       do not give these people your money   no patch to fix the countless game break bug   i d rather play fs       tbf it run well than this
originaly I give this game a bad review   because in the past they never fix the bug   they have really turn this series around   its alot of fun
the in game tuorial doesn t work and the on line one aren t completed   can t figure out how the game work
its a very relaxing game
cow go moo   chicken go boc boc   and tractor go vroom    yeah its pretty good
I don t know how they manage it   but they somehow make landscaping   building placement   and object physic even bad in f    than they be in f   
good
well relax game
let s see   what I get myself into   this time     edit   grate game what u can play at dark winter night s
love all fs game
I love this game   fs     be disappointing in the beginning because mod use in fs     be scarce   now it fs    be well than f    
if you re buy for single player   it s fun   multiplayer be hit or miss on whether you can find a friend multiplayer game list or not          
good
great sim
it be a solid game as of right now with a few minor bug since release   but when it come to price its not cheap but I can see why it stand at       but you could buy it for      less from reseller   the production chain and seasonal cycle within the base game be amazing I would like to see more production point but it be perfectly fine right now and I can not wait when more content get add to the game as a dlc or base game content
game be so fun but you re more likely to win the lottery than find a friend server   absolute           in that sense   without friend the game be not nearly as fun   its    year old and still do not work so have no hope it ll ever be          fix
no way to invite   friend s server don t appear in server browser   other do   after      hrs   look up the issue turn up the same issue span back as far as fs     the most common solution be   just rent a dedicated server     I refuse on principle   but some even report the exact same issue with their dedicated server   I ve be rob
game have some glitch but overall have good game play   my big issue be with the multiplayer   I have spend hour troubleshoot why myself or one of my friend can t join a multiplayer server   currently   giant   multiplayer server display screen be take up to    hour to show multiplayer game after they re launch   with virtually no communication from the devs   either find a way to make this game stable     year after release or let we directly connect to each other s self host multiplayer server
fix the mp and be able to direct connect with server   have to back out and come back in to find a server I be just on after get a mod be ridiculous   its       you should already know how to make a server work and even for people that buy a server and not have it work just blow my mind that you can do this to the community
to be honest wait a month or    until the game be fix   its playable but the bug be something to be dedire with
very relaxing and easy
the good
                                                                                                 
sometime pallet get stuck   sometime tractor go to space   veri realistic   I have good time   I like eat crayon
assume you like farming    by now this game be pretty flawless and there be not many of those about nowadays   very varied game play and can be play simply or with great complexity   oxygendavid have release calmsden which be a sublime map   lot of other map now available and by now possibly hundred of mod   all free   a dream to run and manage compare to my flight simulator and train simulator which take so much time to tweak and modify to get they to work well
farming simulator     be the new pinnacle of farming simulation   season and production chain be a breath of fresh air away from the repetitive cycle of prepare   planting   harvesting and selling that feature in previous game   while the new activity mean farming have never be more diverse   there s so many new thing to do and thank to crossplay improvement   you can enjoy multiplayer with more friend too
I kind of regret purchase this game   giant ruin it with the   patch    the   patch   only create more bug    edit    it seem that create an additional savegame fix some bug   but the pallet physics be still        edit       idk what happen   but the game suddenly get well
new review   server be stable over some time now   it be still a shame that company nowadays just sit through the release phase instead of provide we with enough ressource   but    the game itself be fun to play   my girlfriend and I be work on a nice little farm and its relaxing but still demand gameplay    old review   seriously   another game that fail at launch   no multiplayer on first day   what company should do   prepare enough resource for launch what company do   take the money   wait until hype be over   initial resource suffice
basically farm simulator     with some extra feature that could be mod or an update in fs      game be extremely unstable during startup and need to render in the map for an extremely long time   cause heavy lag and stuttering    fortunately   that nonsense stop at some point   and then you can farm like in any farming simulator game    still a negative review though   because they fail to significantly improve their product with each new release
game be ok up until the late version of window     be instal now the game do not even load   have try all the normal fix but no success as of yet
good game to loose alot of hour on
good game   a few bug   but nothing that ruin the game   pallet get stuck in the earth so you have to use a big tractor to get they out again   have have a couple of fly tractor for some reason   and the occasionally small bug here and there   the late one be    min before I write this   and that bug make my entire save game disappear   but I acctually look forward to start over   fix mistake I do in the first place
farmfarmfarmaffarmafrmfarmarmrfamfamrmrafmrfamrfmrfarmfarmfarfmrfmframmfraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaafffffffffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmafffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
the game be brilliant but have some major bug   my pc be much more than capable of manage this game on the high setting but even though I have read countless forum and follow lot of suggestion on how to fix the issue the crash persist   to make matter bad on two occasion now the crashing have delete my save data file so I have end up lose hundred of hour worth of progress   absolutely gutted because I be really enjoy the game but I feel foolish attempt a second time after the first loss   now that it s happen again I can t risk it happen a third time   if I could get a refund I would
game be great   just a cash   cow   with the expansion   a lot of the thing be in mod already   I be not look to be farm these type of cow    next time I will wait for a way high discount for buy the base game   since I have to buy all the separate expansion    I be very happy that I do not buy the season pass   as many state   it do not even include all current expansion pack   my thank go to the amazing community that point this out in the review   cause it be not clear enough on the pass page itself    for it be such a cash cow   I can not recommend this game   even tho the game be great fun   also previous edition and mod   offer basically the same   and at time an even well experience
I m go to say it       crossplay have effectively ruin this game for pc player   this game look terrible   poly count verticie be all way down to accommidate all of the console player upset about slot count in       now that crossplay be a thing   we pc folk get those same tiny poly count machine map regardless of the    gb   of ram to maintain real poly count   these poly count will also nodoubtedly mean more work for modder to put out less than average material   way to go giant   I ve be play fs since       and this be the first time I m actually dissappointe with a new release   but hey   at least console player can own a different tractor for every piece of equipment they have now without worry about slot
in the quietude of my study   I find myself draw to the contemplation of a game that mirror the very essence of human endeavor   farming simulator      this digital creation   much like the creature of my own literary imagination   be a testament to the relentless pursuit of mastery over nature    upon my initial engagement with this simulation   I be strike by the meticulous attention to detail   a reflection of the tireless labor that define the agrarian life   the game   in its essence   be a symphony of soil and toil   where each seed sow and harvest reap be a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance    feature   the game offer a vast array of machinery and tool   each render with exquisite precision   one may cultivate field   tend to livestock   and manage the intricate logistic of a thrive farm   the seasonal cycle   a new addition   bring a dynamic rhythm to the gameplay   echo the eternal dance of life and death    drawback   as with all creation of great complexity   there be imperfection   the tutorial   though well intentione   may leave newcomer adrift in a sea of information   yet   these be but minor flaw in an otherwise grand design    in conclusion   if you be one who find solace in the rhythm of the land and the satisfaction of a well tend field   I implore you to immerse yourself in farming simulator      it be a journey of discovery and fulfillment   a digital ode to the timeless art of farming
I have really try to enjoy play fs        the addition of season and the prospect of plow snow really excite I     but the game just isn t good   I start out on the first map   forget the name    it feel so bland   the machine   all of they   be lack in their sound   physics have some issue to be work out   tree and branch do not lay naturally against each other or the ground    and there be no saw mill to drop off log at   though I hear it s be work on   lol     to be sure of what I be experience   I fire up farm sim      in my opinion the good title to date    and sure enough     every single one of those issue isn t even a thing in that game   why such a miss   oh     and I be also irritated they decide to continue force upon the player the need to buy land parcel instead of field   the change that happen in fs     compare to         that should have never be force onto the player   we should be able to role play and cut crass in town   cut and plant tree along the road   etc     that s half the fun   this game should have bake into more polish for at least another      month before release   in      I can actually hear my machinery   chainsaw include     I really hate to be   that guy   who seem like I m just not happy with it     but it feel like such a step backwards   it totally baffle I how we get to this point   when      be such a great product   I simply can t recommend this game in it s current state
this be not a new game   this be a polished farming sim     with mod    farming simulator     dlc be come soon   strongly recommend you wait to buy it   they will have their good hype youtuber out push this game    stay strong and wait to see all the detail   do not buy
need a lot of qol and bugfixe before ill recommend
it ain t much but it s honest work
great
exceptional game   feature many improvement over previous title   in the form of physics   fully functional transmission   true character customization   and native season   however   I have two serious takeaway   one be that they still haven t fix the hitbox bug with wood   which make log a pain   shame   as this be one of my favorite moneymaking method in previous game   and they clearly have no interest in fix it   another be that they add passenger support as a feature   then make it so that in order to access the feature   you need to purchase one of their dlc pack   that s a really scummy move for a feature that should have be in the game from the get go   I love this series   it s probably the only game franchise that I will gladly purchase without wait for review or gameplay   and I appreciate that the devs didn t fall into the devil s trap of make their game a timed epic gayme store exclusive   however   until the developer fix these two issue   I will have to leave this review at   not recommend    I will change this review in a heartbeat if these thing be fix
the developer appear to be intentionally ignore issue from user who want to host their own private server and not use the in game advertise server rental service and they do not provide a method to connect to private server outside of their in game server browser   which be horrible and not work   bad   you have to buy an additional license to even host a private dedicated server   it isn t until after you purchase additional say license that you discover all of the issue that people be have with the crappy in game server browser   great single player game atm   but can not recommend it until they fix the multiplayer   which a lot of want to play
the new ai worker be not fully optimize yet but it be fantastic to use
the economy in this game make absolutely no sense   simple balance    cost plus effort you put in vs money reward be totally break   we talk about a game with     eur tag price
       would     degree flip with tractor again edit   noice game   buy it
fantastic game with realistic graphic   action and gameplay   easy to play and succeed   while give a feeling of accomplishment   some bug here and there   but overall a good game
multiplayer do not work at all for some reason anymore and can not connect to server during peak time   will be ask for a refund   a few bug in game as well
multiplayer be total garbage   server be not show up in the server list   if they do after half an hour   no one can join
good game
good farming game ever   so much fun play it with my friend
very nice
it have very nice graphic
recur issue with multiplayer connectivity   edit     day later    issue persist   edit   it s be a week since the release of this game    still can t play
eine woche nach release    der drm    serverbrowser server funktioniert konsequent jeden abend nicht   direct connect o     gibt es nicht   man kommt also auf keine eigenen server   anstatt einer konkreten aussage komman nur copy paste   es tut uns leid   texte
need vr support   graphic be okay   render distance be not great   you can see the circle around your vehicle where the crop stop and everything else be flat   but the gameplay be fun   especially if you like simulator game   I think this would be more fun in vr though
fun but     light source lod be horrible on very high setting   light don t render beyond a few hundred foot   no way to change light render distance in xml setting   everything else be fixable    they make this game in dx    api and have minimal object light lod and no way to expand it in setting   anyone with a decent rig could triple the render distance beyond max setting and be fine   why not let we do that    as it stand now   just stick with f   
fun game   play it on consol   ps   and ps    for while and enjoy it   switch to pc for unlimted mod and specific mod   I would play it on either playstation or pc   control on console lot easy   but mod limit in scope   though be a metric ton even on console    but pc have a lot of really neat mod   though I do notice some mod I have on consol be not on pc
I love the farm sim game   and each one for I have be a step up from the last   my big issue with     be that you couldn t do multiple contract   and when the mod come out for that   I spend my life on it      add so many thing to the game   and I love all of they   but my one con be that you can only have    contract at a time   and in a season where I can t plant anything   I find myself sit and wait for those contract to finish with nothing to do   if you do forestry or animal   I m sure you ll be busy and love this   I love it   but I need to be able to do more than    contract   whether it be through a mod   or a change in the game   if you re like I I recommend you wait   otherwise   buy it   it s so worth it
unfortunately unlike old farming simulator this be a disaster   I play     s of hour on fs    and I be happy   except for graphic there be nothing well on this game than on fs     I be a fan but I be disappoint   I expect fix and the game become more playable   I be wrong   instead we just get kubota no one ask for   after of almost     year of develop game I would expect giant to do well   but they didn t   aside from problem that be still the same throughout the series   I experience thing that unfortunately make the game unplayable   the bad thing be input lag that I have never experience on other of their game   I know my computer be powerful enough to handle the game   it seem as so the game be not   the input lag be at least half a secong which doesn t seem so bad but it be   I experience more problem that I could talk about here for long    as a fan of this series I can only say one thing   I can t recommend this game   play previous part instead
I love farming simulator   I look forward to this new addition to the series even know i wasn t get much more that I didn t already have in modde farming sim      that be say I can not recommend buy this game as it currently be   the constant   non stop bug make the game frustrating beyond belief and damn near unplayable in part   the most challenging aspect of any game shouldn t come from the developer s inability to design the game properly   I shouldn t have to restart hour of work just because a tree I cut down bug out and be now smear all over my field   it shouldn t take I     minute to figure out how to load one pallet of lettuce by hand due to the fact that it s now stick in the ground when all the other pallet move just fine   take it from I wait for deep sale on this one   or at bare minimum wait for a lot bug fixing patch to come through first   wish I could refund
change to recommend now that the devs have sort out the game break bug   a much well version than f   
   fps to    fps nice
multiplayer be dog water
fs    have its bug in the past but now its get well be nice if there be more   x usa map and more real life featcher like grass dieing when drive on it and getting stick in mud when it rain
play this game for     hour   game blow just enough to piss you off but not enough to allow for refund   be aware of this    save the cash and buy something else
well after quite a while I have change this review from negative to typical fs game   while the price be a little steep still the modder have once again make the fs game enjoyable   giant have do quite a bit of tweaking that have help too   still lot that need to be do and that could be do to improve this game
I d be embarrassed if I be giant   so many bug and so many issue in this release   do giant not have beta tester       how do you not check the numbering of field   how can you not see the   whole   map need plow and lime   how do you break implement that work perfectly in previous version   the list go on and on   as of this review   it s be out for    day without any update to fix any of these issue   I remember when germans be know to be excellent craftsman   I guess that doesn t follow suit when it come to game development    prove I wrong   giant and I ll revise this review
   god game
gud game   
word can not properly express how unimpressed I be with this game   I be a farmer in real life and have be play the farming simulator game since        I have always enjoy the series and have be happy with every game thus far   in       to       I have well over       hour in this series   however this be by far the bad installment of the series   and I feel I speak with experience   this game have add absolutely nothing to the farming simulator collection   the developer be at fault   I understand that the game have always be support by modder and the modder be what make the game   the developer have add absolutely nothing to this installment   they have take modder idea from previous installment and just throw they in   there be nothing in this game that you can not already do in f     for         I feel that this be a slap in the face to the farming simulator community   this game have become even more disconnected with real farming   it have add nothing to the series   and have take a good name and ruin it   my advise be stick with fs     its a well construct game with more playability   thank to the modding community f    be a real farming simulator   fs    be a waste of money   thank to all the modder out there put in their hard work and effort to this series   but I feel that the devs have really let we all down with this one
I guess we as a society need to accept that the minimum viable product be a reality   I be super hype for fs    as I play f    for quite a while   I don t know how long f    have be in development   but it feel like they rehash f    and spend about    day produce this disappointing garbage   I don t know if they beta test fs     but it sure seem like they didn t    contract be just about all bug   can t accept new one   some don t even complete   some have field info swap with totally different farm plot   play multiplayer with my son   in the same household    the game just randomly lock up and crash   go through about     crash then finally quit   no consistent way to replicate the crash   but I feel like a beta test would have show some of these bug    overall   I m pretty disappointed   I always take negative review to heart having purchase many thing online   I always think    well I m sure it be a one in a million chance they receive a broken product    I be even somewhat in denial about the thing I be see online about f    have issue   I figure they wouldn t happen to I     but they do   I d expect this type of thing from a free game   or heck   even a        game   but not       x   for    copy     do well   giant     shame on you
very good and well make    love it  
tractor  
so many bug   multiplayer doesn t work   I can t join my friend game at all
farm
break game   some harvester do not offload into trailer mean you could spend a load of time harvest a large field and then you can not do anything with the harvest   its a shame as the game have massive potential but have this critical error ruin it for I as if this simple mechanic doesn t work then dare I even try the more advanced stuff that would waste more of my time
in my opinion release f    too early   as there be way too many vault and way too many mod that have vault as well   there be no follow I mod   and course play be a joke   so difficult to use   I time should of be take over the game never mind about people keep ask when it be go to release   I spend     pound on this with the game and a season pass   and although I have try to play it   it will not play right   and yes my pc be well advance so its not that   why be course play leave and just revamp   its back too fs    for I   bloody waste of money   such a shame
how be this possible to have a game this break literaly everything break some how there be not a single thing in this game that work how it should just how be a multibilion dollar company able to f up this g d da n bad I just do not know what to do laugh or cry   why the hell even dedicated server be down when giant server hamster be dead this be so absolutely stubid xd do not buy this      ubdate   day    server hamster be still die giant need to just fire all their dev team leader and get new one      day    server be still die and winter season be a joke it do not exist   day    cow do not produse any manure alltho there be manure heep they have straw and food   gear box be a joke   harvesting job be also break   day   seed mission let u borrow a seeder that can not even seed the thing u need   pallet get stuck on the terrain   and server hamster be still die winter season still do not exist   still no patch
tractor go vroom   enough say
good
all the stress   monotony and deadline of be employ without the hassle of getting pay         fun game
great game most of these negative review be completely wrong
beer   farming    twitch yt    good time   would buy again    have not test the online server host yet   so that opinion be reserve for now
it will keep you busy   I now know more about farming than I think I would ever know and still have a ton of stuff to learn   lot of content with a great community of people and modder   game graphic and physics be good   make sure to check out the mod and map that be available   some really good one out there
I buy the key for this off of green man game so I can not return for a refund   would not really do that if I want to as it can be fun when it work but it have to many bug that need fix asap but at its current state   I just can not say buy it   contract mess up   map bug in and out of show stuff   everything put in train silo disapear   contract lose we money cause they will not finish so we have to cancel and lose money for lost produce   just not fun   I also pay for a server and now my friend who I be go to play with do not want to play cause of these issue so I be out of more money     
fs    have expend on the previous farming simulator game by add thing like landscaping   make the design of your farm more personal and add more creative element   as always it also have an excellent and wide array of mod   definitely recommend it
not worth the full price   no real improvement over f     besides now you have grape olive and a custom avatar   multiplayer experience have be abysmal   most mod be not work on mp and without mod this game be unplayable   no qol improvement   still have to load each pallet manually   ai worker get stick every time   no guide to tell you how to do thing   even the crop product symbol have no label   skip this
bug   spiky lag make multiplayer unplayable   try to tough it out to find the good   could not find it
      very good
very well make and a little hard than f   
great game
always relax to farm about a bit
great game play   I m enjoy the graffic and the intigrated contenet from farm sim     mod   the only thing I m have an issue with be that the semi truck do not seem to be ablr to pull much weight   for example the new style mack truck can barely haul potato
its a fun game yes    but there be way to many bug in this version       pallet getting stick in ground     contract that can not be complete   even when the field be       harvest   and all grain be transport     contract disapeare when accept they     game crash during autosave   and not save at all   so everything since last save have to be do all over     the new gear system   suck        the tractor can not figure out which gear to be in   in auto   which sometimes end up in a tractor stall in a field     scroll in the menu   esc menu   do not always work   unless you click somewhere first
I allready play a few hour   and I must say it could be a great game   but that s the point   it could    so far many bug   especially with wood and sure instinct task   multiplayer crash   with rerollback and so on    I try to write a support ticket   but the contact formular be disabled on their website xdddd    edit   I think they get rid of this   
play this game for a good    hour together with a friend   I will state that this be my first entry of the farming simulator franchise   and the first time play   though with an co op partner experience with the previous entry      waypoint marker sometimes do not even remotely point to where you need to unload the harvest good   the map marker for canola on the map erlengrat point to the far east limit of the map   next to the biogas station   when the actual objective marker be a point more toward the middle of the map along the train track      infuriate vehicle control   I m not expect arcade control   but back up with a trailer be a   chore      you get stick on everything   lamp post that would realistically snap like a twig completely stop you in your track   so do traffic   or a bush   and don t get I start on the time I be got stick on a low wall with no way of reset myself     you can play co op   cool   you can t ride together in a pickup that clearly have a passenger seat   what      very high   graphic setting still deliver a horrible draw distance   you need to manually adjust this in the advanced setting     for long time fan of the series   this might feel more at home   but I be a bit stumped on some of the mechanic     graphical glitch here or there which be negligable   but at some point   our hud just go blank with no way of refresh it    honestly   the game keep remind I so much of the arma    mod altis life   where you do job around the island and trade   just without an ounce of fun   or any kind of excitement   or   the funniest moment in gameplay be when I just ram my friend s truck off the road with the harvester to see what happen   it tip sideways   he have no way to right himself   and I have to ram he from the other side    all in all   with the current state it s in   it be not worth the price tag   it feel like a beta at full price   with a season pass potentially double that initial cost   I will probably give it another chance after it have have some time for bugfixe and patch   but this will likely be the last fs game I buy from here on out
fun   alot of new thing compare to        if you enjoy the other farming sim game you ll enjoy this one   helper be more useful   plus there s more tool   and more factor to consider run your farm   good game to kill alot of time
game be break
yes
good game ever I can not stop play it
it s good
great game for creative people   especially in coop you will have a lot of fun
the good game I ve ever play
good farming simulator version to date
the developer do a great job with the attention to detail   I love how they go as far as to add weight limit to the trailer   there be still some bug to work out which I be confident as time go on they will work out   but overall the gaming experience have be well than expect
most unstable farming simulator to date   game get progressively laggi as you play eventually lead to crash and even just crash out of the blue with no prior warning and have do this since launch day   the game overall wasn t a massive upgrade from farming simulator     with only a minor graphic update and a sound overhaul be the most notable change   some crop be also add    for all you be get the game be way overpriced   not to mention on the modding side of thing we be still wait for crucial program to aid in convert mod well after release
the game be awesome   I ve always hate farming but this game convince I it can be very interesting   I play with my friend and we be very satisfied   we re farm on one map   everybody have their own farm   we expand our land   earn money   buy new machine   help each other   borrow each other s equipment   it s just a pure fun   there be many various and interste mechanic in this game   ton of mod be available   I highly recommend
a game where you can actually chill
if you like farm   this be the game for you
it have a rockcollector
complete rubbish compare to fs     constantly crash   and my pc be more than capable of play it     year wait for this   sort your       out giant   
my favourite game to spend time on and just relax when play it
good farming sim yet by mile
would love to buy the premium edition package but be prevent because I own the base game   I guess ill just stick with the thousand mod I m already use rather than give giant more money   seem silly to prevent I from buy it   good game though         hrs in   
farming simulator     be the good game I have ever play   to start off the graphic be very good especially on the vehicle and tool   the audio be also very good   all of the vehicle and animal sound be great   the actual farming in the game be very good and make it feel realistic   sometimes it can get boring but if you take small break every now and then it be alright   one feature I like be be able to turn thing on and off like stone and weed in the field   overall this game get a        I       recommend get it even not on sale
game run well   power pole and house on the map interfere with any type of big equipment use   the ai be too dumb to get too any assign field for a task   the actual town road be too small to actually allow any ai big equipment too move   they put tree and other item right next to the end of every field so your unit can not actually turn around when you build any type of building if its not       even when you spawn it you be stick with large area of terrain that be unchangeable   when you buy property farmland let say one with some previous structure   you can not remove they   they haven t fix any of this since the       edition   please get new employee   I actually enjoy this game   I want the issue fix   I would love to farm a giant field with full sized equipment without it run into a tree   I m not try too anti farm sim   but the bug be so obvious   I don t understand why they don t get fix but dlc s be release the terrain editor be literally the bad I have ever use   I do love the large amount of community mod   it do add a lot of variety    please fix the issue before more dlc s thank you
after a few hundred hour of play already there be a few thing that need improvement   first however I will say that I absolutely love this game    achievement   they be title nicely   but then follow up by a pun   I have zero clue how to achieve any of they   please update the achievement to tell we exactly what be need    silo capacity   in fs    we have    type of silo capacity   own by we and not own by we   so the game tell we what we have on our farm vs what we have at off site silos   be there anyway to get this separate again for f     also in the build menu   can grain type and or material be add to the silos   when I be start   it be confuse try to figure out what go into silos    production chain   if there be a    tier production chain   like the greenhouse that each tier produce    cycle per month   if the other    production be shut off   shouldn t the remain thing be produce at    time the speed   so if I be only produce strawberry but nothing else   the entire greenhouse show full of strawberry but be the exact same cycle per month   if you be devote your entire production chain to a single thing it should go fast in my opinion because it be dedicate to a single thing    I so super love this game   thank you giant
kvalitka
bread
fix some stuff
the game really lack polish    the performance   especially when frequently work with pallet and tree   be really bad   and tree can even corrupt your save game   I be really miss improvement over previous iteration of the game in this area   and I don t even wanna talk about multiplayer   that s an even big mess performance wise    and to be honest   their big problem seem to be a really simple one   communication   communication be key   be transparent   interact with the community   tell we about the bug you be already aware of   tell we what bug you be work on   guy   its        you can already see thread like   do they even care    pop up    the game have so much potential   yet I regret I even buy the game at this point
buyer beware    this       edition be enjoyable yes   but disappointing again   they ve be make the same game for ten year but can t seem to improve game mechanic in any substantial way   the vehicle availability and vehicle model be amazing   as always   but the ai be clunky and just leave a lot to be desire   as always   there be so much potential here and so much room for improvement   but it seem the      of the development budget go straight to vehicle brand licensing and   d vehicle model    all the dlc available be for more amazing vehicle model that I wouldn t want   if I be to spend more money on this game   I d rather it be on an intuitive ui overhaul   an intelligent ai upgrade   an interactive world   well physics   something   anything   besides more vehicle
tractor but new
drive through my field with my tractor and ruin all the crop       
game run a lot well than at launch
graphic much improve   lot of small thing I m notice in the detail   very nice  
it have well graphic    can lock thing to the trailer now   and many more thang to enjoy so check it out u ll be hook      just understand it have a few little issue but in time they will git it strait     farm on ya ll   
absolutely   very nice very nice   boyfriend love it   
they take a already good game   and pretty much make it well in every single way    especially the sound   well do giant   well do
immersive   interesting game   I love be a pig farmer who know  
just awesome   
   cute game and everything   but too expensive for its level   and improvement be need
all of the dlc s   conveniently title and package into   season pass   and   premium platinum   edition be highway robbery   any actual game altering dlc have prove to be a       show
one of the good game this year   most game have be pretty disappointing with battlefield be the cherry on top   this in my opinion be the good launch and have ton of content        recommend
I ve play farming simulator since       and its a great game and the community be awesome aswell
become farmer   grow crop   have cool tractor
it be not easy   but its honest work
it be not much but its honest gaming
good game
game have be out for a week   multiple issue in game   and now I can not even load into my pay online server with just ingame mod on it   extremely dissappointed
come let I play for a couple week then stop I from play and dosent load up keep have to uninstall then reinstall to be able to play hope someone can help I fix this
I enjoy create in the game   graphic be wonderful
very good make and fun to play   ton of hour in it
yess
have a few bug but hand down such a beautiful game
fix the          bug s        s
I spend around       to get season    and the tractor dlc along with the base game   why they would include all the dlc in the season    pass I do not know   the game be so full of bug that be not be fix that it be almost unplayable   the multiplayer be never work so I can not play with my friend at all   I be very disappointed with gaint   the condition of this game at release be absolutely criminal
farm innit
the weather be such a great addition   and the game be just ridiculously detailed and in depth farming simulation as always
after play this game for an hour   I have spend all my life save to buy a cotton combine and have no field to plant   my life be doom due to this game
many many of the bug have be iron out             stability and lack of bug      gamplay concept      graphic     no extra sauce it be what it say respectable but improvable
I pick that cotton yessir master
awesome game    
just play fs    a while long until the mod bug be implement fix       I mean     its   good      but if your draggin ur foot to buy it then I would drag a little long     its   playable   but the contract bug and cut lumber graphic bug be unbearable      not to mention the invisible wall on the map edge and all the useless building on the farm     oof    
I ve be play farming simulator since the     version   giant have very much raise the bar in the     version   the ability to order worker to automate several different task have make a big difference in the gameplay   almost make it too easy to make cash   lol   but it leave you lot of time to explore different part of the game that you may not normally investigate   so if you re on the fence about buy this game I d say go for it   you re sure to enjoy it   highly recommend
the game be good   but have its issue    the game have a few bug which make the expirience of play the game annoy   miss name on map   unable to edit a farm you buy so stuck with the unusable building there   use the bag grabber cause the tractor to glitch out when swap tractor   you have to reset both the tractor with loader and the bag tool   if you sell while gliche it become a ghost tractor and sit on your map forever    the season pass do not give you everything   the new tractor they bring out cost extra    no update have come out since launch   why not    there be a long list of other bug we have all submit and still await some minor fix    I love the franchise and this bring alot of new feature and do not get I wrong I will still play it but its not perfect   allow I to edit the map as promise and bring out some bug fix and I ll change my review
I don t know if its just I or what   but I have constant issue with glitch in this game   I ve lose    or    save profile just because a tractor get stick and break the entire game   not to mention item like crate ect   get stick in the ground and if anything collide with it your game will also crash and you will lose your save   game have its moment but it need some work before it can compare to fs  
well than battlefield     
although the game be an upgrade of farm sim      the game be effectively just farm sim     but with a different number   I expect more
game not launch its a piece of     
the game crash and I could never start it anymore   very disappointing
it s farming simulator     with some improvement       year for the same graphic   really  
good   
   even though I recommend this game   I will give it a thumb down    wait for atleast    to    patch before purchase      
the game run poorly   its definitely not my machine as I be well above the recommend spec   the way in which the vehicle handle be beyond belief   with or without a controller   I m new to fs and there be next to no help give when try to learn the basic   its just very complicated and not new user friendly   I m sure if you be a frequent player of the franchise its great but for a new player       too much
graphic be horrible   don t even come close to what be advertise and there isn t even a tutorial   and their steering wheel support have a massive dead zone   they do not fully support the steering wheel   since the setting have to be tweak from window   control panel   no sensitivity setting in game for the damn steering wheel and pedal    overall a massive disappointment just like fs    be  
I buy heavily into farm sim      and also buy the platinum edition of      with that say I love the game but after read review on the year    season pass and decide that the review speak a thousand word for the developer   eh hum   I feel that I can no long buy from or support this developer and would recommend for anybody read this review to dig a little deep into the review for the season pass and make the decision yourself   already feel like a money grab to I hope this help    ps I enjoy play fs     and purchase it as a test to see if     be worth the price   p s   I have revisit seem that the season pass be not so bad but   the game be as before and run great   untell you try and play multi play   then its like try to play on a dial up modem from the      s come guy you can do well than    k dial up for your server host   how do u expect people to give great review if you be be so cheep   wake up it           I do not recomend for multi play even if you pay for a server but game itself be well since my original review   get the dlc in the premium expansion and have a great game that be fairly resonable now
most of the time my friend server will not pop up
tis good
its fire
good game
 
fs    be well
one of the good simulator game ever
fun game
plow and what next      ahh time for look another map   
so good you can almost smell the cow s   t    the vanilla game be good   but the hundred of mod available take it to a whole new level   you can make the game as easy or as difficult as you want    one good thing about the game be that you can mess around with dangerous whir agricultural machinery without have your arm rip off and throw into the next field    a must buy for jeremy clarkson fan   
gerasgaimas
great game  
I ve be get in and out farming simultator since fs        genuinely   this be one of my favourite game to play   especially when play multiplayer with friend who like farming as well   be a simulator   it realistic to a certain point   of course   if you re a farmer in real life   some game mechanic be too much simplified   but in my opinion   it be all right because this be a game for everybody   sometime get a bit boring without some background music   graphic wise   its all right for a sim   I would like to get some well ambient occlusion and lighting effect in f     for a       game   it s a      
I love the realism
it be very fun you should really try it you will be happy it be so much fun
penis
like tractyor   
very nice game
veri najs
the multiplayer in this game never work
fun but can take long for plant to grow and to make money but fun
great game addicting   not generally my type of game    but this be
back in my day I have to sweat ma ball off to get this work do   now I m just lazy
like
tractor
great game   be play farm sim sin fs       many many of hrs spend farming and build a farm you look for a game that be a great time killer   nice an relax experience highly recommend
I suppose   yes   I do recommend it
I ve be play farm sim for a long time now   I start on my ipod with like f    but it be a      year old game by then   I would always watch creater like the squad and see all the crazy mod and be amazed and I dream of play fs and now I ve be so lucky for that dream to come true and I get to use some of those mod now   I would say that anyone who have a computer that can run it should       get this game I love it so much and can not wait for fs  
   farming simulator will give you an more like    realistic experience    compare to       and if you wanna spice thing up   then download some mod and use a wheel from logitech and you ll get an really realistic experience    I really like the production chain in this game we never have any of these factory on the other game        
if you like arpgs fs    be probably the right game for you   I m crazy you say    ok let I explain the game in arpg term to you    so first you pick up your quest   buy your field   than you get some gear   machinery   to conquer the dungeon   field    logically the next step be to enter the dungeon   field   and kill all the mob   put in the crop   in the dungeon   field    to get to the boss   harvest    next step be to kill the boss   harvest your crop    depend on your gear   machinery    this can be a easy or a hard job   and finally after defeat the boss   finish the harvest   you turn in your quest   sell your harvest   and get a reward   to upgrade you character   buy new machinery   for make the next dungeon boss   planting harvesting   easy
its so realistic
very good game really enjoy it for farmer its very good
play the life out of it   mod the heck out of it to get its full potential   love the building aspect of the game
I like tractor
don t waste your time or money   so many time now ill go to get on the game and all my career and in game mod be go   wipe everything you have do
not enough cool truck car mod for roleplay need more of the actually good mod like old ford and dodge etc
backa med sl p simulator   
everything be very good about the game its just that every time I try to save the game it will not save   so that be just hour and hour of work out the window
if you haven t play this game then I highly suggest do so   it will hold your attention for hour and the level of detail it have be mind blow   don t let the fact that the new version be come out stop you from play this game as it have a lot to offer with content
ls    be a farming simulation that take the genre to new height      its attention to detail and expansive gameplay mechanic create a rich   immersive experience that s perfect for both seasoned player and newcomer         from planting and harvesting crop to manage livestock and equipment   every aspect of farm life be meticulously craft      the game s stunning graphic and realistic weather system bring your farm to life in a way that s both beautiful and challenging        however   while ls    offer a robust farming experience   the learn curve can be steep   and some player might find the initial setup a bit overwhelming       additionally   the in game purchase for premium content can feel a bit excessive at time       the dynamic season and engage co op mode be standout feature   allow you to share the farming experience with friend and adapt to ever change condition        ls    be my ultimate farming getaway a game that blend detail and fun perfectly   even if it have a few bump along the way  
fresh install on a pc that have never see fs     game crash during load map at        apparently game developer have fail to deliver game update that work with late nvidia driver
yes
so if you have any other plan for today   cancle they      oh let I do this really quick     and    hour later     I really get to shut this game down   but let I do this really quick   bam      be    where do the day go  
install farming simulator     and your kid wife will leave you         would install again
farm
         crow get off my field
poor graphic and physics but otherwise aight
I love this game but I uninstalle it beucase I m open up space for farm sim     but over all its a very fun game to play
currently the game crash no matter what map I try to start   both new save and old save   I try verify the install and a complete reinstall   but nothing work   I have a top end pc and all my driver be up to date   so it seem the game be neglect while they work on fs    since you have to use old driver from       and probably window     for the game to work at all   do not buy if you play other game and want s to keep your pc up to date
if you re new to this series then prepare to spend literal hour on youtube try to figure out anything because their tutorial cover scratch your butt and then you re on your own   that s if it doesn t bug out also   one of the least friendly game series to new player   it s like they don t like the idea of make more money and expand their player base lmaoo
super skibidi
fun
this game be absolutely amazing   
big vehicle
what do you mean this game isn t about ramp random vehicle    ft into the air      I can farm     
real man game
fs     be a great game to play   my kid all play too
gud game well yn the w rld
graphic and game play be great if you be a skilled player   I have difficulty figure out how to load truck   harvest and process product   navigate the camera while landscape and place building be difficult   this game would be great if it have more detailed tutorial
so I buy this some time ago and be fun to play with friend or even when you re lonly   when you be allon in a server    world the progress will be slow and also will be less fun to play   the game popularity be also decrease even tho it become free on epic game
good game very modded lot of way to play the game
very nice
it s one of the game where once you play   you see farm equipment everywhere and your eye open   plus can be fun with a friend who s equally addicted   get yourself a drink   put on your favorite radio and farm   yeeyee
   it be good but need a hellcat
""
really nice and chill

tend they field
grete geame ton of mod I havd playd     h combind whit consel
it ain t much   but it s honest work
ok
great game
   
good
non violent farming game
I eat the grass sometimes
this be an amazing game   fun so play in multiplayer mod only increase that   my only wish be that the multiplayer list work work well
while enter the game for the very first time   I be truly captivate with the remarkable and sophisticated world of farming within the game   farming simulator     offer beautiful graphic   the very first point   the detail of the landscape   the authentic weather above the field   the realistic moving vehicle all be part of enhance the enjoyment far more   this game have great gameplay mechanic as well   the control be simple to comprehend   and right from the begin one be capable of diving into the action whether you re a regular fish or a new player to this kind of game   and with an immense selection of vehicle and equipment available it be quite the alternative to new each and every one   one of the aspect of the game that I enjoy the most   be how they ensure as much realism as possible in the game   from control the stage of growth of crop to manage the market for the numerous product   comprehensively run a farm be make to look and feel authentic   it s not just a simple case of planting seed then sit around wait for they to grow    it s about plan how to plant seed   and then what strategy to implement in order to make it in today s world of agriculture   but perhaps the good feature of the game be the creativity that player can use as they see fit    the game let I express myself in whichever way I want whether I be hold onto the traditional farming technique or use some of the most advanced farming technique available   to summarize it all   farming simulator     be a must
I do not like this game because of the many hour it suck you in for   I ve be play it on the ps and now here too   it s like minecraft in that it s follow you on every possible device and platform there be and in that it s much more fun to play with friend   especially when thing    mod    go spacex on you
super
da

not only can you farm   you can do much more    modding have be a big upgrade from f    in general   even third party mod be even well   I feel the graphic be well than f    and I love the new map   grape and olive be welcome addition and I love the new rpm system where there be actually gear now   I feel this game be       worth it and if you be go to use the dlc s pick up premium edition as it come out much cheap in the end    farm wise   the game have change but only a little   now you have    new crop and you also have to worry about season   there be great new and old tractor which I love such as the old jd s   the new equipment be amazing and I love the addition of rock as it s more realistic    sure it can be annoying but that s the reason why you can disable they    game wise   it s amazing   the fact that there be utv s and two nice car be a great car as the fs series never have enough vehicle to pick for your farm   it also seem as they be allow name brand such as ford and chevy which aren t license to giant in the pc only mod hub   the addition of cross play be also amazing as I can now play with my xbox friend    I have also be play fs    since day one   just on xbox instead
my tractor do tractor thing
cool
ever since the first time I play farming simulator   I ve love this game   my problem be with the devs   this game be only playable with mod in my opinion   you can not have an enjoyable experience with     base game like you could with             blah blah blah   but why be this    I think this game have have a rather large downfall over the last couple of year   I remember load into f    for the first time and be take away to a whole other level of simulate experience however when fs     come out   I wait   I wait patiently for the modding community to do their terrific work which allow I to enjoy the game    with     I be expect good thing such as   improved fieldwork    the devs do a pretty decent job on develop extra step for the player to experience a good level of fieldwork and variety in say fieldwork   such as rolling and all that good stuff   well ai    the ai be terrible   feel bad than previous edition of the game vehicle handling    drive around be all good but yet I need mod such as enhance vehicle setting   fantastic mod btw   in order to feel a real sense of   well   real life   well crop    with the new game always come new crop   however I think its unfair that the main new crop be hide behind what a essentially a rather large paywall   have friend that aren t able to afford dlcs mean there s a great lack of multiplayer capability   and enjoyment   don t get I wrong   cross platform be great     when it work    but that s for you to find out   texture    why be this game graphic so highly saturate   why do I need to use external app to make the map I play feel more real   the modder do incredible work with texture and graphic but my point be that its not their job to make the game feel more real   its a simulator   its suppose to be pretty real   I understand not everyone have high end pc s   I include   but if modder be able to create such texture and have they implement into the game   why aren t the standard feature or setting   basic game play feature    I dare you to open up farming simulator   go down to modhub   scroll down to script or game play   and tell I how many of those incredible mod could   actually no   should be base game   if its too difficult for the devs to do   hire the people who can do it   such as the community   now look in the tractor mod and tell I why they couldn t be base game machine   yes I understand certain license can not be acquire   take a ford tractor license for example   you can not get a license to recreate a brand tractor in a game if the brand no long exist   but they have a john deere license   we get    old style machine   they ve get a new holland licence   no old new holland ford tractor from the     s   there s mod that be these type of tractor but again   if the busy modder who have their own life and job can add these feature as a hobby   why can not the devs    disappoint    without mod   this game be really difficult to enjoy   with mod   this game be a fantastic look into the industry of agriculture   don t get I wrong   there s plenty of basic farming aspect miss   but we make do    for anyone look to get into the franchise   I highly suggest go back to fs    or even     and learn on those edition because I can guarantee you ll have fun whilst you learn   once you ve get the hang of thing   come over to     and have a play around   see how you feel   and start experiment with mod    I know I ve get a lot of hour on this game   but it make I sad that after all that time   I m still not happy with what the devs have accomplish   look back on previous version really show the drop in care or commitment that the devs seem to have   I m sure   some of they   be work hard and do care   but like everything else in this world   it seem to be all about the money nowadays   there will be a point where the community get bored of this lack of effort from the developer   you see comment on facebook forum   and steam review   and youtube video that show how upset the community have become   I can not even remember the last time I see an update to this game where the devs actually do something   this game be get old and old and yet the ai be still break   texture still flicker during different season   basic script add on such as pro seed still aren t base game   and I m not sure the game change mod that make this game what they be   will ever be implement    a quick example before I go   season   season be and absolutely wicked mod in     and      and we be all so excited when we hear it be base game in      but its still so broken   planting calendar be just not realistic at all   I can not change month length from    day to    without have to leave the game   because the set doesn t work   its just disappointing   and what about passenger     need to buy a dlc for that mate      I know a lot of people will say its just a game and not everyone like to play realistic   but what about those who do   what about those who want to play a   farming simulator    I appreciate those of you who don t always play realistic   or prefer to do some logging or mining   I enjoy a spot of both of those too   but the game just feel unfinished in a way   I m sure it ll be blame on covid   but for how long will covid be blame   its       as I m write this and yet I m sit here say a game that s now    year old   still feel unfinished    so with that say   get it   or do not   its your money    I do not even know how I feel about this game anymore   and that make I sad   so I m go to go and cheer myself up by do a spot of plough I think    tell I what you guy think   I need a second opinion
love the game   the on y issue be they give you so many mod however you be not able to fill your map with a lot of the mod
this game have be a godsend   I ve grow up in the country and this game bring back the good ole time of my neighbor do there crop

farming simulator      a veteran farmer s dream come true   as someone who have till the virtual field of farming simulator since its early day   I can confidently say that farming simulator     be the pinnacle of the series   with each iteration   giant software have hone their craft   and fs    be a testament to their dedication to the farming simulation genre    graphic    gameplay   the leap in graphical fidelity be immediately noticeable   the landscape be lush   and the equipment gleam with a realism that only year of refinement can achieve   the addition of seasonal cycle not only add visual variety but also introduce strategic depth to the farming experience    new feature   the introduction of new crop like grape and olive   alongside the winemaking and oil production process   offer a delightful new challenge   it s a joy to expand my agribusiness beyond the traditional   explore avenue previously untapped in my farming career    community    modde   the cross platform multiplayer bring together a community of like minded agriculturist   while the modding support continue to be the lifeblood of longevity   with endless possibility that keep the game fresh long after release    final thought   farming simulator     doesn t just simulate farming   it celebrate it   it s a game that have grow with its player   and for veteran like myself   it feel like come home to a bountiful harvest after year of investment   a well deserve five star
bs

farming  
 
the game be good without mod   and of course   you can see the game feature in the official game description   farming seem realistic   even more so with how much patience you have to give it   the map be open roam   you can do whatever you want   and it have a multiplayer mode to play with friend   on the modded side of thing   you can get mod from the main menu or from trust website   with mod   you can add more machinery and vehicle   tool   building and structure   feature   and a lot more that can also be use in multiplayer   I ve have a ton of fun with my friend   brother from another mother I swear he be my brother dude lol   and I think many other people will too
it s really fun

peak
one of the great game I ve ever play   I be enjoy this so much I want to get the rest of the dlc     wouldn t support these devs again   be ban from their discord for try to ascertain how to upgrade my version of the game   a moderator tell I   very rudly   that I need to   remove the game from my account and re purchase     do a support ticket on the giant website and its be a month and no answer     there be no option to upgrade your version if you have the standard or any low version   you have to spend more money than the complete edition   its a scam
they make I buy the game twice if want to upgrade   cheap   premium edition   worth the money   would recommend farm to be farm    start farm virtually from harvest moon as a child farm ville as a teenager and now farm simulator as an adult   there we go my pass time   
this be the good farm sim out of any so far   however to start this off there be no major bug   thus be prepare   this farm sim have a pretty steep learn curve   equivalent of just drive into a wall   it s a ton to learn and take in   just in the basic of equipment operation and field preparation   that doesn t include the add difficulty that come from   animal husbandry     different animal type    crop management   crop yield boost   and production chain   don t get I wrong in anyway the game be great   but control be incredibly unintuitive   physics be um something   the game do a horrible   job of explain literally everything   and finally if you want to download mod via the in game mod launcher good luck your go to be sit there a good few hour   besides that I d highly recommend this game and if the dlc   espically the season pass   be on sale get em
its a good time waster   enjoy play with a couple friend here and there   can get really repetitive really fast
I m love it

be a really good game
good graphic
  I only play this with my friend    as gameplay go   it s pretty nice and relax   but     the multiplayer server connection suck   I ve lose count on how many time I ve   lose connection to the game   without ever get to join the server   sometimes it aslo take      year to load the server browser    giant will probably never fix or solve this   it suck but it s the truth    server connection          fix this or loose a future player buyer   gameplay       fun with nerdy friend      
farming simulator      fs      the late installment in the beloved franchise   earn my       rating   with enhanced graphic   an expand roster of vehicle   and a more immersive farming experience   it cater well to simulation enthusiast   the addition of seasonal cycle add depth   reflect real world farming challenge   however   the game s mechanic might feel familiar to series veteran   lack significant innovation   the modding community continue to enrich the gameplay   offer diverse content   despite its incremental improvement   f    deliver a solid farming simulation experience   make it a worthwhile choice for fan   though it might not offer a groundbreaking leap for long time player
   I love it
great
nice stress less game that seam some what accurate with real life farm
get this    day ago and have       hour I will say watch this be not that fun but playing be so yeah great game
