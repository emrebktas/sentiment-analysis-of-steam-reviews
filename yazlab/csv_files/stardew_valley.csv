one thing I never realize until I finish the game be that you shouldn t rush it   I get everything do    year in game   find all the secret   get       completionist on the tracker   find all the secret cutscene   collect every hat   accessory   ring and weapon that be available in the game and have complete all endgame content   but when the credit start roll   all I feel be emptiness and a void that I can no long fill up   this be a wonderful game that s just so invite and calm to play   whether it be by myself or with a friend and now it be all over    if you have get the time to spare   take my advice and enjoy the slow ride   don t rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on   because all there be at the end be the credit
stardew valley feel like come home    I can t remember which playthrough I m on   which be a rarity for I   I ve revisit childhood favorite like zelda and mario countless time   cherish each experience   however   as an adult   this happen less frequently   maybe it s because modern game don t resonate with I as deeply   or maybe my gaming habit have simply change over time   yet   whenever I boot up stardew valley   it hit all the right note   whether I ve talk with the resident of pelican town dozen of time or play through its event repeatedly   the game retain its magical allure   it feel like a nostalgic return to childhood gaming   a comfort experience I can enjoy every time of the year    what s truly remarkable be the developer s commitment to continually expand the game with substantial update and expansion   all provide for free   stardew valley brim with passion and love   despite its status as one of the most successful indie game of all time   the developer continue to pour his heart into it   enrich the experience for player   I deeply respect and appreciate this dedication   which unfortunately be no long a give in today s gaming industry    and after all these year   I ve finally reach the summit

if you look at the playtime above this review   you might be think to yourself      how on earth do one person invest      hour of their life into a game about farming    well   it s a lot easy than you think    stardew valley open with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job   only to be remind of a promise that they have make with their grandfather so many year ago   a promise of something to brighten the shadow when life become too dreary for they   our stalwart protagonist wave goodbye to the grey wall of their office to board a train to stardew valley   an unknown paradise far away from the city   and it be here   where their life truly begin    I can only wish that we all find our stardew valley someday   yee haw
I convince my brother to help I buy our mom a ps   last christmas so she could play stardew valley   she be play the same animal crossing game on wii for year   so get she to try something new be risky    after my brother show she the tv app   mom humor I and let I teach she how to play   she make a farm   and sort of catch on to use tool    it s august now   she s log over      hour into that farm   her cellar be pack with keg   the seashore be red with crab pot   she wield a flashy return scepter that I ve never even                  turn mother into elite gaming machine
this be a game that I have be look forward to for at least    and a half year   I have want to have a game on the pc that have the element of harvest moon   for the little bit I play of it    animal crossing       and rune factory   I be super excited when I be approach by leth   publishing manager at chucklefish   at the beginning of december to help he and concernedape   developer of the game   with bug testing and qa        hour later   off steam and on steam    I still love the game    the farming be fantastic   it be to I one of the main element of the game   and it s just a joy   be able to design your farm any way you want it     yes please   plan out what to buy every season   where to plant they   on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold     it s so enjoyable and addictive    the fishing be outstanding   from play wow and runescape    or any game with fishing   the fishing in stardew valley be so much fun   at first   the fishing be challenge   but as you progress your skill   you become a pro in no time    mining and combat be incredible   go deeply into the mine can be tough   but if you re prepared with your food and weapon in hand   you can fend off the creature and get your sweet ore mineral gem that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard    hi   I m bexy   and I m a hoarder     social interaction be great   be able to become friend with the people in the town   and eventually be able to get into relationship with people and have a family with they    what s not to like about that   and what s great be that it give great replayability because you can have different save with different spouse   the backstory for each of the character too be so in depth and well think out   you will be silly if you don t shed a tear maybe once or twice    the actual main story be well rewarding   and once you   complete   it   you can still continue on your adventure and farming life with no problem   hell you might even discover new thing afterwards   I sure as hell do    yes   I be a tester for the game   yes   I have play for ridiculous amount of hour   it may feel like I m be a bit overzealous with this   however you have to remember   I be a tester   I test the crap out of every aspect with this game   even though there be massive game break bug   error   glitch   crash   I still love this game   I report many a bug   and concernedape be quick to fix they    and that s the thing   not only be the game amazing   the developer be too   concernedape work around the clock to make sure that bug be fix in quick time in order for we to have an amazing experience with this game   and that s true   the experience that you have with this game be amazing    minute play turn into hour   hour turn into   oh no it s time to sleep    you will forget about time   you will forget about sleep   you will forget that dinner be about    hour ago but you couldn t   remember because you be too busy try to fight off     bat that be clobber you inside the mine while try to gather that    diamond waaaaay in the back    so yes   I without a shadow of a doubt       recommend this game to anyone that want to   escape   for day on end with what I be classify as my     game of      
I m genuinely impress an indie game of this scale make by one guy isn t stick in an eternal early access   but be instead provide as the full package right off the bat   this be how it be do a decade ago   and this be how it should still be do
barely play but pretty good
this game didn t cure my depression   but it get close than anything else
   note   update as of              introduction   stardew valley    I ve hear a lot of thing about this game   a lot of extremely positive thing    and I be doubtful   be stardew valley really that good   I be afraid that people be just give it attention because they didn t actually know what a good game be   and as insulting as it may sound   in my defense   uhhm       before buy the game I hadn t really see what it look like   or know what it be about   I just know that it be publish by the same company   chucklefish   that have develop starbound   I have love starbound    so I be play completely spoiler free   haven t watch any video   no tip    trick   just the information of a billion recommend review stuff into my head    so I buy stardew valley   and have pretty high expectation   if a game receive that much popularity   it should be seriously good   right      plop   into the world of stardew valley    you completely start from the bottom   trail after a tragedy and responsibility that s strike   a farm   barely any money   and the mystery of a town leave in your hand   whew   that s really a lot when you think about it     boy   do I not know what I be get myself into     at first   I be mesmorize   or maybe lose be a well word   the beginning s all new and immersive   and the middle     kind of leave you stick   but   this be because I be impatient with the game   I go in want to finish it asap   however   I realize this game be not simply for you to buy and finish   it s something else     entirely    the thing with stardew valley   it s all about exploration and management   discover and figure out secret and a beautiful story be amazing   creative mechanic and powerful creativity have combine to produce a fabulous well form game that leave a sweet taste in your mouth   and I m go to tell you right now     it s totally addict    I buy the game a few day ago   and literally have play it all day since   I ve never do that with a game before   I find myself as a kid in a candy shop   gape at all the different flavor   and be able to savor they all   and now   in year    of the game    I still have a lot more to discover      compare to other   I ve only play around      hour of the game thus far   buy stardew valley   you really win t regret it   this game be beautiful   the music be whimsically lift   and the soundtrack be wonderful   it s a work of art   you will find yourself fall in love with the character   and the daily routine of be a farmer who restore the life around people   and who change everyone for the well   it s so relax   so addict   and so much fun   I have play game for year   play game with far more hour than I have with stardew valley   and yet   I always turn to stardew valley first   why   it s amazing   it offer something to everyone    the game reward for the hard working   stardew valley be a game where you really have to manage thing   yet   it allow you to explore the whole art of it   work hard as you play the game   and there be sweet reward   and I m talk about reward sweet than all the candy in that candy shop    here s the thing   you can take two route with stardew valley   you can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game   or you can immerse yourself in explore the town and what the game have to offer   but with also miss the point that stardew be a management farming game    or   you can successfully find the balance between both   but how    stardew valley allow you to store multiple account   which be fantastic   I recommend explore with your first account   and learn the rope   you seriously win t know anything yet   and will be like   omfg   when you figure out there s a way that make thing one hundred time easy   after that   create a second account   and start figure out farm management and what the game have to offer   this be a game in which you learn from your mistake    and now     I m leave in a spot where I can successfully thrive   and only continue to grow        enchanting music that sing as you play     a simple yet fun art design that you can t help but fall in love with     character whom capture your heart     a shamble town that begin to thrive     hide secret that you can t help but want to keep discover     amazing challenge that leave you want more     brilliant originality   which be incredibly difficult to find     a storyline that change your perspective beautifully     lot of fun   and I mean       mod create by the community to make your game more fun and immersive   however   I play without mod      it finally have multiplayer        as I say   the game reward you for hard work   but only for hard work   it can be a grueling process   but it be extremely profitable   those who don t like put effort into a game win t enjoy stardew valley as much as other game      time   stardew valley take a lot of time to play through   it s a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on      repetitive   the game can be gruele   to reach certain goal you have to go through process that you will seriously hate   but   in the end   it s definitely worth the labor         I wish there would be more character   once you go through the storyline with everyone   there s not much lore leave      more secret and new area   of course      stardew valley offer a lot of thing   and have change the life of many people   perhaps in peace   wonder   open mindedness   the game give a lot   but I have one thing that s be bother I for a long time     how in the damn world do one single person spit out a freaking awesome game    even though it s a farming game   which be commonly find everywhere   it s original with its own spin   it s extremely difficult to find a game that have such a captivating message that s be develop so well   stardew valley be a lot of fun and awe   and it really draw a blank in your mind    buy stardew valley   at first   it might seem mediocre     but keep playing   trust I   the candy be still sweet   and they really only get sweet

stardew valley be a very special game to I   it be one of the first game I ever play on steam   it help to ground and distract I when I be go through depression and rough patch in my life   I think the charm of the game be its simplicity   beautiful music   relationship with villager and cute animal   you just seem to slip through time and forget your worry    I use to play with a special person who become my good friend and rock   but we have drift apart and don t talk anymore   sometimes   when I miss the memory   I visit our old save and reminisce about the past   please hug   kiss and catch up with love one   make the most out of the present    overall   beautiful game   please buy it
personally I find this game really enjoyable but I don t think I ve play enough to give a proper review just yet
stardew addiction be real guy
I spend three year build up hype   and I be still blow away    if you enjoy harvest moon   rune factory or animal crossing    then get this   it capture all the same thing that make those game great   and it s the perfect game to play either casually or seriously   there be so many different way to earn money and they re all developed and fun   the hard part be choose which one to spend your time do    the progression curve in the game be fantastic too   every day you ll feel like you re make progress but there s still always something to work towards and you win t   beat it   after a couple of hour earn as much money as possible   as there s always something to spend your money on   even after     hour of play   I feel like I m nowhere near the endgame   and I could easily see myself play through again and do thing differently   I m even do a playthrough on youtube and the progress feel dramatically different even in its early stage    I m easily disappoint by game   so you can imagine my surprise when I be so impressed by a game make by one person   congratulation   concernedape   you ve make one of the good game I ve ever play

you have little to no idea what you re miss out on until you actually purchase and play stardew valley for yourself   it be one of the most fantastic   relax   open world gameplay experience you will ever play in your life   and one wouldn t know that by simply look at the game graphic alone   stardew valley be how a game should be make

I be never interested in farming game   I ve never play a harvest moon game or an animal crossing game   and never have any interest in they   the close thing to a farming game I ve ever play be minecraft   I definitely would have never try stardew valley if I wasn t an achievement hunter and it didn t have achievement    but now I see what all the hype be about    stardew valley be a game that be very easy to lose oneself into   there be many element of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life   especially the game s premise   you re stick at a soul crush corporate office job when your grandfather die   leave you an envelope tell you to open it only when you ve reach your absolute limit and need something new   after a particularly bad day at work   you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather s farm on a far off island   so you take the plunge and decide to move there   it be a very strong analogy to the game itself   where you   the player   be seek escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game   not know what else to expect    in stardew valley   you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trash plot of land   as the day go by   you can clean up the land and discover hundred of way to make a profit with what you ve be give   from buy seed and plant crop   to raise animal   to fishing   by mean of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event    to forage for wild food   and even to explore a few combat centric zelda style dungeon   but you re not make money for its own sake    there be dozen of mysterious secret scatter about the land   each with significant and game change reward at the end   and you need to raise the money and resource to investigate they all   the game experience be go to be totally different for everybody depend on what game element you be inspire to pursue first   although you ll assuredly be look at a wiki in due time   it be deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece thing together yourself for as long as you can    year consist of four month   each month be     day season   some gameplay mechanic change with the season   particularly that certain crop only grow in certain season   and   almost   no crop grow in winter   so you ll have to carefully consider what seed to plant and when   each day last about five minute   and you ve get to make sure you re back in your house by   be   or else you ll pass out and lose some money   the big way the game hook you be the fact that your progress be only save at the of a day    so if you re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crop   it win t mean anything unless you play the whole day through   a vicious cycle   I clock      hour of this game in the first    week of play   that s how bad it be    another one of the game s strength be the cozy little community you live beside   with a population of about     people   the game do a wonderful job of make each character feel like their own entity   with their own daily routine and backstorie and motivation   you ll really get to know and love they   you can give gift to character to increase friendship level with they   unlock character development cutscene and important reward   you can even date some of they   you can have    boyfriend and    girlfriend at once if you want   no joke   relationship be gender indiscriminate   and then marry the character of your choice   the social aspect be sometimes a bit too real    you ll feel the pain of rejection all too often    but that make the successful relationship all the more heartwarming    as for complaint   surprisingly   the game have some strange and baffle bug   most of which be visual   like ice skating horse    but some which affect gameplay   and a few known save corruption bug   I also feel consistently uncomfortable with the control   if you re use the mouse   your cursor need to always be in proximity of your character   or else you ll only aim at the tile in front of you   make it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while work   and if you accidentally click the wrong tile   your character will turn to face it   change the default direction you aim   compound the problem   it can be infuriate   especially if it cause you to accidentally destroy crop   also   I don t like how you can only talk to npc if you have a tool select   and how you ll use a consumable item at the same time as open a door if you have one select   the control could definitely use some additional polish    then there be the inventory control   if you click on an inventory item   you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot   if you click on an inventory item with a storage box open   you will immediately transfer the item into   or out of   the box   thus   it be impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open   if you click on an inventory item while in a shop     I can t tell you the amount of time I purchase      seed   then immediately sell they again just because I try to pick they up and put they in a different slot    also   I can t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already do    perhaps more dungeon   a big map   and the ability to run more than one farm   but   as of this writing   the game be still in active development   include a co op multiplayer patch in the work   and a lively modding community    I give this game an        a wonderful example of what all those crappy farmville mobile game would be like if they be actually balance around gameplay and not milk the player with microtansaction and daily login bonus   despite some stupidly distract bug and annoying control   it s some simply wonderful escapism   and make I finally see the appeal in a farming game   it do get stale in time   but not before offer a huge amount of joy   for achievement hunt   it ll easily take about      hour   especially blind   but if you re like I   you ll have it over with in a month or two   a huge thumb up

can I just say thankyou to the developer of this game I suffer with depression and stardew valley give I a reason to do somethng other than sleep it make I feel like I have an impact of people live   even if its only in game people    I have play       hour play this game that s      hour distracted from my real life problem   I have ope sp   in to be a beta tester   this be the first game I ve ever do this with thank to the developer for say how to do that I really admire he for create such a good game and hope he go far in his career and he never lose the magic   thankyou
I ve pick up this game several time and it didn t click in the way I think it would   I get too catch up in the   I must do everything every day   mentality which   like in real life   doesn t work out very well    once I learn that there s no time limit in term of   year    you can play infinitely   I be able to settle into a relaxed   I ll worry about that next year   mentality and now can t stop play
I grow up play harvest moon on the sne   my parent probably rent the game a dozen   time before put up the money to just buy the damn game   my brother and I dump hour   and hour   and hour into that game   beat it multiple time to see some of the different ending     a few year ago   for the first time   a game be release that best the original harvest moon   that game be obviously fortnite   jk    stardew valley be such a good spiritual successor   that it beat the original hand over fist   it s entirely it s own game   while nod its head to what I assume be its source inspiration   it exceed my expectation by a lot   and it continue to be improve on again and again     this game have a lot of replayability   just ask my wife who have nearly       hour log by now    between different relationship   different focus   different game altering choice   and different property layout and design   there s enough content to keep you entertain and come back for a very long time     it might seem minor   but the game soundtrack be probably one of the good   if not the good out there   chrono cross be my former favorite   but only stardew valley have lead to I purchase the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl release   okay   one of those be a gift    it keep the game from get as monotonous as it might otherwise get sometimes   its similar to the tetris song   after enough play   the music be ingrain in my soul   lmao    gorgeous pixel graphic   amazing variety and load of charm   the creator clearly have a deep passion for this game and it show in nearly every way     this game deserve so much more money and appreciation than it get             stop          around and buy the game already   I do not care if you find farming bore    ps    shout out to my brother   he never get to experience this masterpiece   but at least we have good time on harvest moon   he would have love it   rip          
this game be dangerous    when I first start play I be like    it s cool   farming be fun but I don t really see the hype around it     then I keep play    it s         so bad that I have     tab open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game   I open the game and blink and two hour have pass   and while I feel sad that I just lose so much time   I look at the progress I make on my farm and think    worth     this be one of the most fun game I ve ever play    it s design in such a way that it allow both casual player and competitive    optimization orient player to have a blast with this game   there be so much to do in this game   and there s so much to offer   you can spend your day farm   fishing   mining   forage   talk to the villager   etc   the game be make in a way in which you don t have to hyper optimize every little detail like min maxing profit   time management   etc   because there s no time limit for thing   unless you count season   but there s always another year   and there s no stake   but if you want to   you definitely can    talk to the villager be fun as well   they re well design   and you can even find pattern in their daily schedule   there s a lot of detail in this game    I haven t try the multiplayer   but from what I ve see it can definitely be a lot more fun with friend   but play solo be extremely fun as well    my only gripe with the game be that it s a huge time sink   I wait until my semester be over to get into it because I hear about the time sink beforehand   and I be glad I wait   because all I can think about now be    what crop be I go to plant next season   where I should place they   how much money be I make from these   should I fish or mine   do I feed my animal today   do I talk to robin today     and of course   robin be good girl   no discussion there

I have play this game for      hour       on the switch       on my computer   my cat in real life be name junimo   I love this game so much   and little junimo be the light of my life

help my depression
this game literally save I every winter through my severe seasonal depression   I can t thank concernedape enough   this game give I purpose and joy in november when pretty much nothing else do   it s also the most wholesome thing I ve ever be addict to
stardew valley be an incredibly personal game to I on top of be just one of the good   most fun and addict game I ve ever play    having play       hour on steam and probably like       on switch   I ve still not touch a bunch of endgame and or   perfection   relate content   yet   I ve enjoy every minute I play   I love the way you unlock more ability and craft recipe for every branch of the game the more you focus on they   I love the fact that everything you can do in the game be a solid way to make a living   hell   you could probably toss your hoe away and finish a lot of the game without touch the farming aspect   which be crazy for a farming game    my personal favourite way to make money   especially in the early game   be to just go fish   the mini game be challenging and reward   the more you play it the more thing you unlock to add an extra challenge and make more money   get more diverse catch   and so on and so forth   this be amplify tenfold by the new update bring new event relate to fish in particular   and the mastery system it add be a great way to incentivize player to revisit previously   complete   aspect of the game    bit of a tangent   but the multiplayer be a fantastic addition add in       be a large timesink for myself   I myself have play the game mainly on switch when this drop   having once hand my switch to my mom and say   I think you d like this game    I get it back like a week later   she be absolutely hooked and eventually get her own switch in       to play animal crossing and play stardew valley together with I   which we spend a good few hundred hour on   she buy the game for I on steam in       when I be      and I buy the game for she on switch in       when I d recently turn      so it be kind of a personal gift for I to buy her    rest in peace   mom   you would ve adore      and absolutely despise the squidf event   miss you every day

there be plenty of game out there that might give you a high high   get the high score in a lobby of some fps for example    there be plenty of game that will give you a low low   see your companion die in some rpg for example    but in over     year of play video game of every shape and size   no game have ever make I as happy as stardew valley    just happy   I love stardew valley   and I highly reccomend anybody play it
this game be nothing short of straight beauty   I have never play a farming sim before this   and honestly I think I wouldn t like it because it be so different from the game I usually play at the time   fps    as soon as I crack it open   I feel the joy of      perfect headshot of a pvp match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain be melt by the gracious and time take beauty of stardew valley   the amazing     bit design of the character portrait   freshly till ground   and don t get I start on the fishing   without any guide   I make         gold before winter   and even with watch guide   you never feel like you re cheat yourself   because there s just so much joy to it that it be impossible to ruin the game with watch video about   spoiler   and   spoiler    I be amazed to learn that this be create by one guy   mr   eric barone   may whatever god he believe in bless his soul   as he have bless mine with this amazing game    tl dr    great   mind blow         no complaint
as you can see from my hour play I adore this game    whenever I search for a new game I go to the review and I make sure that the majority of the reviewer have play for more than      hour   amount of hour play give a game credibility in my opinion    I have play and play and play stardew valley in many way    I have try all of the map   explore every inch   and grow to know every character    tonight my hubby and I be delve into the multiplayer beta and I still feel thrilled as if it be my first time play    the music be relax   the atmosphere be enjoyable   really everything about this game be make for one such as I   I have a four year old and at night after bedtime I hop on my computer to calm down after the day   I nearly always go for stardew valley to really destress    though recently I have be attach to my time at portia lol    but still I come back to stardew    every new time I play I try to knock out another steam challenge or two    I try to woo new character    I try to keep it fresh    and   thus far I still love this game as much as I do the first time I open it
I be a     year old mother   probably one of the old people play this game   I be a widow and a single mother to my son who be now     year old   my son have recently start play stardew valley   in less than a week he have already play over     hour it be terrible for I because it be already hard enough for I to spend time with my son because he be always with his friend or watch youtube video   so I decide to create a steam account to play with my son   I start play   but it be my first time play a video game since the      s   so I be pretty lost   I ask my son for help and we spend a few hour play together   I love it   as it be the good time I have spend with my son since my husband died   play video game remind I that there be fun in everything   and it bring I and my son close again   and now we actually spend time together
this be the game equivalent to a long time good friend for introvert    you may have some question at first   may have doubt   but the more time you spend with it   the more you attach yourself   the more it become a part of you and part of the thing you cherish   it s the game you always come back to   the game that help you relax when you get anxious   the game that be there with open arm when you be ready    do yourself a favor   get this game   just trust I
by admission of the dev himself   this game be harvest moon at its core   a formula that be purely addictive and satisfying as hell    but there be something stardew valley have over harvest moon   and that s a heart   the intro to the game be incredibly human and relatable   I sympathize with my character right off the bat   I think we all know how it feel to want to escape the mundane grind   and in a funny kind of way   this game do that    a moment I feel that the game truly have a soul be when I be walk to the mine on a rainy day   when suddenly I be greet by a cutscene of come upon abigail   my romance interest   play a flute next to the lake   it s a very quiet scene   with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing   after some dialog   my character   who be a silent protagonist by the way   pull out a mini harp and join abby in a duet   something that really surprise I as there be no indication that my character have any musical talent prior to this scene   it be a bonding experience   and it feel incredibly real   memorable   and touch   I ll always remember it    and when you realize that there be ten love interest in this game with different scene like this for each of they   man   that s an intimidating amount of content    maybe I shouldn t be say that harvest moon doesn t have any heart at all   but when it come down to it   this be the game that I m go to remember more fondly in the end   I make memory with harvest moon as a child   now I m make memory with stardew valley as an adult   you should too   the game be worth full price and then some

I be a     year old biker and trucker father   and probably one of the old people play this game   I be a single father to my son   who be     now   my son get this game for from his uncle   so we instal it on his computer and he start play   by the end of the week he have     hour on this game   this be horrible for I   as it be already hard for I to find way to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch youtube   so I decide to make a steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game and start play but I be stick on what you where suppose to do   I ask my son for help and he host a game for I to join   I love it as it be the good time I have spend with my son since my wife have die   this game have ever since bring I and my son close again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well   this game remind I that there s fun to be have in everything   and it have bring both I and my son many happy memory    thank stardew valley
my husband introduce I to this game in       and I have be addict ever since    and go from farming parsnip and fishing to expand the world via mod   then create mod of my own   suffice to say   stardew have become a significant part of my life   now        hour later   I ve just start my many th farm to re experience the game from the beginning   and strive once more for perfection    stardew be a game that be simple on the surface   but the world barone have create be open enough for player to develop their own lore   and have inspire   in I   fanfiction and mod idea   the repetition of the early game   the watering   the fishing   even   to a point   the monster slaying   have a meditative calmness to it that allow I to unwind after a day at work   the character may appear superficially shallow   but once you get to know they you start to realize that they contain hidden nuance and become more than character on a screen   they become your friend
the fact that concernedape be still create new content for this incredible game more than    year later that will cost you nothing should be reason enough to celebrate this game   top to bottom stardew be a labor of love   I can not overstate that this game be perhaps one of the great indie video game ever create   I will be play this for year to come          because a scale of     isn t big enough for stardew valley
stardew distract I from my existential dread

this game be just fantastic   obviously you can see that from the   overwhelmingly positive   review here on steam   so I will keep this short and try to focus on negative and thing you may overlook in general    stardew valley be what pc gamer have be look for to scratch that harvest moon animal crossing itch   if you like that type of gameplay   just buy this   don t overthink it   it do it all   and more   what put it over the top be the customization level and modular building ability a la style   and oh boy be there depth        I mean this be make by one guy      beautiful artwork that have attention to detail   I mean it even change dramatically with the season   its incredible    music be absolutely a treat   and once again   change with the season    controller support work ok   I m just glad it exist     character customization   male female   slider for color   your appearance change with different gear   etc      you have a large farm to work with   the world in general be a good size   there be     npc s all with their own schedule and agenda   the pixel art for their face be outstanding    you can have a pet   and get marry   I haven t even do anything with the latter   yet     there be mining and fight monster   although the fighting be casual and isn t even completely necessary    I could go on and on here really       sometimes   the controller support part   feel   glitchy until you learn how to use it   mainly the part with the right stick    nine hour in and I m still figure out nuance    it would be great if the hotbar be long so to minimize go into the pause button to juggle thing    the bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its content   why not allow the player to retract item put in right up until they go to bed   its not a dumpster   so thing don t get   taint     if you like this genre   this be a no brainer
I like to fish   I play in co op so that my friend can farm and I can fish alone all day   good feature         fishing   might fish in real life after this    edit   it s be three month since quarantine start   and I have yet to fish in real life   also my friend be level    fishing haha noob   I catch the fishie   my job

   I didn t like this game at first and only play it to satisfy my gf    now   I m ask she if we re go to play it before we even get off of work   it have honestly earn its place in my heart and I m so glad I give it a chance    I didn t think I could love a farming sim    come from a fps   dark soul background     over   k hrs on console   but thus I write this   if you have a gf friend son daughter wife husband and you haven t get a game in common this will become that game   this game have improve our ability to communicate and plan thing together and be both get so hype with every bundle we complete   very satisfying   oh crap      I just notice it s only      honestly shock about that       give it a shot   I think I   m go to start my own solo farm     the graphic may not be ultra hd   k but when you have a beautiful game play loop and a town that actually feel alive   all that crap just fall away and you can then see that graphic don t make a game   heart do and this game have a mine          a little awesome history I learn   this be make by one person and he have put     year of his life into make it        thank you concerned ape

stardew valley be a fantastic game and it deserve to be play for an infinite number of hour   I will recommend this game to anyone without any doubt   and in this review   I will try to explain why this game should be play and enjoy    my progress I imgur com       story well the story be quite simple   you be a hard work person who be employ by a big corporate firm   but you be start to get flood with work   your grandpa have recently die and leave you a typed letter which you can open when you be most in need   you think this be the time and you open the letter   whereby your grandpa tell you that when a certain part of life come you need a change in order to feel normal again   in this case he invite you to go to his farm in the valley which be now unattended     the game offer a huge amount of gameplay mechanic which be very nicely implement into the game   you have chiefly    gameplay mechanic   farming   fishing   mining   forage   combat and season   in my opinion farming be the main focus of the game   you can plant crop   water   protect and harvest they   they be your main source of income   the variety of crop be huge   and since the game have    season   there be crop which only grow in particular season   while other crop can grow for consecutive season      be quite hard depend on how much time you want to invest in it   again affect the type of fish you can catch   catch fish be my main priority in my first hour in the game and my main source of money   it s quite hard to make money out of fishing   but I find out how to later   you can find treasure while fish so keep that in mind   be good for when you get bored of fishing or do stuff on your farm   it s very interesting and after couple of visit to the mine you will be plan how many level you be go to do in    day   in the mine you be go to find all kind of item   like mineral   geode
so this be a fantasy farming town life sim in the ilk of harvest moon so rather then beat around the bush   how do it compare    farming   on par with harvest moon   hm    some extra detail   need for scarecrow   fence etc    but it s also miss feature like the ability to selectively breed superior level of crop over multiple generation   there be some balance concern but be a pc game those can actually be patch   livestock     lack variety and some complexity but be more realistic in some respect   for example there s no animal taming   just purchase   breeding be in but you don t bree well livestock it just replenish number   and be gender blind    grooming be more detailed but less hand on   the one noteworthy improvement be conceptually allow and rewarding field rotation    relationship   superior to hm and it s a fantasy life   fl    but inferior to rune factory   rf    I say superior to hm but really it s about on par in term of the mechanic but with more romance option   include same sex    it fall behind in term of character variety   depth and interaction compare to the rf series but update could easily catch up     note rf improve on the hm formula be pretty much every way so will be compare primarily to it now    mine   on par with rf   behind fl   one area it be behind in both respect be variety of ore divide by region   stardew valley have    location you can really go mining   they have a lot of level   which be divide into different biome and there s some rng in ore availability on any give trip into the mine but it s still overall more simplistic term of layout and progression   where it really lag behind be the actual mining interaction   it s just click on the rock   it break   rng loot    lumberjacke   this one complicate as it s be mix with the concept of forage   lumberjacke by itself it close but still behind rf and way behind fl   forage also add feature such as get tree seed off tree for immediate replanting   find seasonal wild plant   which you can in turn get seed for and farm   eliminate the wild foraging once you ve complete that season set    and at certain time of the year collect berry   the other title have these feature   coloured grass and fruit tree etc   but they weren t tie to a skill you could improve   much room to improve here   especially in term of the mechanic    fishing   ahead of rf   close but still behind fl   something that must immediately be point out be fishing difficulty isn t stagger so there s an easy progression curve   where as in the other game the seasonal fish in the location you have access to at the start be easy to catch    get hard as you unlock more area and progress to later season   stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill   plus the rng will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again    again   practise the skill and improve equipment alleviate this over time but a lot of people think fishing be impossible start out as although there be easy fish to catch to start   you aren t direct to they and rng can still screw you   the mechanic themselves work well once you be on top of they but still more depth that could be add to compare to fl   but otherwise quite good    combat   behind rf and fl   there s no real depth to the combat     noteworthy weapon type   and you ll mostly just use sword   plus bomb   which you will not use in combat    no spell   no special move   right click do do an alternate thing like block or ground slam   but it s not effective and you will never do it    no companion   no real footwork   just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy die   the only tactical consideration be more frustration with the control then strategy   enemy variety be lack compare to the other   first     level there s only    variety of enemy   those who passively stand there   one that charge you   ground or fly    and one that charge you but occasionally block   one that burrow to do so    for all the above the strategy be pretty much the same   maybe dodge   hit they before they hit you   keep hit   then they add enemy that shoot at you   same deal   much room for improvement   that say the rng nature of the dungeon leave a lot or potential open for this to be develop far if the dev decide to so    craft   way behind rf and fl   no weapon armour craft at all   equipment upgrade handle by a shop   cooking and deco piece be just click to create   super simplistic and uninteractive   that say   there be one area of it where it be ahead of both rf and fl   decoration     in addition to the ability to lay fence   path etc   you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm building rather then the usual fix location when you unlock they   except your house    greenhouse   you be free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both   craftable    collectable   largely anywhere you want on the farm    to some extent all over the town as well   doesn t compare with say ultima   or a minecraft terraria clone   omission intentional   but it s a big step up within this genre    festival   far behind rf   once you ve see they once most the time you want to skip festival in stardew   they be mostly just low interaction cut scene that waste your entire day   even when the festival say it will end at   pm   you ll get home at    pm   day over    you can t give gift   go shop or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival day and very few of the festival will attend offer any kind of benefit   the townsfolk don t really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attend at all or not    story   behind rf    fl   the story be very simple and very lightly apply   the one interesting aspect of it be it seem to make a social commentary on small town independent vs corporate growth culture     but it s doesn t seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour   it just complement two different playstyle respectively   the plot really boil down to if your character presence improve the life of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of    year or not   the hand off approach be great if you don t want the game jamming plot event down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim   but it mean when you be look for context it be rely entire on the depth of it s character interaction   where it be sadly lack compare to it s rival   these aren t shallow character   but the arc be short and arbitrary and there be very little individual interaction throughout   some scripted event be cool but like the festival the character have no real self awareness of how they go down after the fact    collection   on par or well then rf fl   behind animal crossing     p good potential here   museum collection will be expand in update too    art music   subjective but good quality regardless    overall   if you be look for a story base game with more interactive gameplay mechanic it s a fantasy life be a well choice   as far as farming sim specifically go rune factory have more depth and still stand as personal good in genre   I haven t mention polish until now as although stardew be behind all competitor this be day    since release and there have be no less then    patch fix most major issue and many small one   when you consider this game be make by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive qa it s unsurprise launch have be a little shaky   but regular patching will fix this   edit     largely have    an advantage of a pc release   do I recommend it   absolutely   it might not be good in genre but it s a solid entry   have the potential to improve and be definitely already the good on the pc platform and by extension steam    if the genre appeal to you   get it   easily worth the money
the most wholesome game ever create   and be still nurture by the developer after five year   my nomination for steam labor of love award         stardew valley be not just a farming sim   it s a life sim   it s not just a video game   it s an experience   and one of the most immersive one ever exist   unlike some other harvest moon clone that either force you to grind hard or have tedious progression   stardew let you relax   set your own goal   choose your preferred pace and tell your own story   there be so much to do in the game that can t be write in just word   and it just get well the more hour you put in it    only a few game make you feel the love the developer put into they   stardew be definitely one of they   good wish to concernedape for his upcoming game
  when you gaze long into the abyss   the abyss gaze also into you      friedrich nietzsche   some people may have tell you that stardew valley be a   chill   game about farming and make friend   someone might have tell you that this be an easy go   relax game that can be enjoy by anyone   even those who don t normally play video game   those people be wrong   for I   stardew valley be not really a game at all   it be a mirror   reflect within it the darkness of the human condition   and my own inability to escape it    at the time of this review   I have log      hour into this game   I have complete the community center in it s entirety   and I have perfectly optimize my farm for brutal efficiency   I make million of dollar each season   and   for no good reason   I continue push just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become   I have never speak to a single member of the town who can not benefit I monetarily   if you ask   I would likely only be able to name    npc at good   I almost never go to the town event and have often find they to simply be obstacle or annoyance in my personal quest for power   this game may be relax for some   but for I   it be war   there shall be no item leave unpurchase   no crop leave ungrown   and no slime leave unslain   I be become death   destroyer of world    if you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power   this game be for you   conversely   if you just want to have a cute little farm and role play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy   this game be probably also for you   either way   if you value your mental health   or maintain   actual   productivity   the abyss be well leave un gaze upon

short review version this be what I do for thousand of hour in stardew valley   I work on this guide since the first release   I ve test      item for        time to     villager   I ve chop ton of wood   I ve smash ton of stone   I ve reset the game for hundred of time   and I almost lose this guide because my hard disk corrupt   in case of another disaster   so I ve to release this halfway work   whatever I currently have    I believe wiki s info be slightly inaccurate   that s why I make my own data reference   you can still refer to wiki if some info be miss in this guide   this guide will be continuously update when I have free time   I may be busy at life   but I ll try to push update to this guide   as multiplayer mode roll up soon   I will include that as well       once I play harvest moon   back to nature on playstation    and harvest moon   friend of mineral town in gameboy advance   then I continue to play hm fomt in visualboy advance in pc   gba io for io and gameboid for android   I go for plantation   mining   fishing   feeding animal   woo all the cute girl   unlimited fun hour     dude   which girl be you chase     elli     just pass your game cartridge to I for a day   I ll make she grow to red heart in no time     then help I to get             g for vacation house     we swap gba game cartridge   grind it all the time after school hour   that be my childhood memory    it all begin when a friend of mine tell I about stardew valley which arrive into steam store   a game that pack most of harvest moon feature   which I play back from ten year   time   I go on check at steam store   apparently   it look similar as harvest moon   but I doubt how fun it be   all the while   the only farming simulator I love be harvest moon   none other than that   thankfully   my friend borrow his steam library to I   for the first two hour   I be surprised that finally   finally     a real farming simulator on pc platform   we do no long run on emulator    so the first month   as usual   I clear my land   planting parsnip and then go hunt for extra berry and grass   but ala   what I notice inside be totally blow my mind   no grass but with different loot and proper item name   dandelion   daffodil   spring onion   leek   grape   hazelnut   and then   there s bus stop   an overhauled open town that doesn t vertically or horizontally align compare to old harvest moon   quest   fresh storyline   ton of letter and goody in my mailbox   combat mode in mine   and minecart    this stardew valley be a new fresh farming simulator   at first   I m at lose   but since I m an ex harvest moon addict   I still can keep up with the crop   however   challenge turn in which you have to defend your crop from overgrown weed or crow attack   something new   you can feel it   in my first run   I use to be a monopolist   spend all my money on seed and gain maximum profit   but then   the funny part I place almost more than     scarecrow to protect my crop    I ve no idea how far a scarecrow range can cover   how to simultaneously plant and harvest crop   how to organise item and much more   in my thought   there might be steam guide that help player to play well   it take I few minute to load a whole guide with heavy image   image be wonderful   but still a lack of some detail   and much to my disappointment   lot of guide in steam community be heavily plagiarise with the assistance from wiki    ten year ago   as far as I remember   game guide for wiki hardly exist   or maybe there s one     remember how we use cc cheat code   ign walkthrough     and many more old site   veteran player be very well verse at this   most guide be solely write in text format   the tradition of write text guide be fade   no comprehensive steam guide for stardew valley community ever have do this    I stop my game in the middle of winter   year     over the month   I compile all item and complete gifting   day by day   datum by datum be be add to my work   one day   my portable disk go corrupted and thankfully my only backup still reside in my local disk   thus   I ve make my final decision to post my work in and steam community as what you ve see right now    I as a fan of harvest moon and stardew valley would like to thank all of the public contributor who have spend year to compile and post detailed online walkthrough for everyone to enjoy hm game   and now we re move on to stardew valley   I want to do the same extensive guide for stardew valley   also not forget to thank all my close friend who have help I to test and verify game datum too   as I continue to compile the remain datum   your feedback be greatly appreciate    feel like I m relieve back some good ol   memory   soon I ll have my own print stardew valley guidebook on my bookshelf for my collection   maybe I ll be play this for another ten year   thank   stardew valley

to start off by say that I avoid this game for year be an understatement   I think this would not be enjoyable for I at all and the sad part of that come when I say I be judge this game base on its name   when I get it   I begin play it reluctantly but find it an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience   now I m        addict   its get a fun dynamic and interesting storyline
you know what game doesn t need my review   stardew valley   there s nothing I could possibly say about it that other people have not say yet   but it s criminally unfair to have play so much of it without rate it   so I m go to rate it    if you enjoy resource scarcity game without strict deadline   a charming   colorful world with thoughtful character   logistical planning and min maxing strategy    I mean   it s all here   if you ve play graveyard keeper   or littlewood   or harvest moon from back in the day   and like they at all    you owe it to yourself to play stardew valley   it be insanely cheap for the amount of value concernedape have pack into it   and he continue to develop interesting   fun new wrinkle in regular update   every time I start over I find thing I miss before

stardew valley be an uniquely entertaining game   even though it appeal more to casual gamer   this game have a lot to offer   whether you be interested in combat   farming   fishing   socialize   etc    stardew valley have be the thing    I must begin by say that the art style of the game be just purely beautiful   I can t think of something that would fit well for a game like stardew valley   it s really neat   seeing game that aren t afraid to take a more minimalistic approach and succeed   the soundtrack be also a key element in the experience   and it deliver   not only do it perfectly fit the game s atmosphere   but it be also one of those soundtrack you ll dearly listen to even outside of the game    the premise of the game be simple   life in the city finally overwhelm you   you decide to open the last gift your grandfather give you before he die   he leave you his farm in stardew valley   and so your journey begin   you be greet by an abandon plot of land which you must restore to its former glory and by the nice little community of pelican town   a small town near your farm   so you start discover the joy of a simple life there   day by day   as you slowly but steadily gain the trust of the citizen   turn a profit from the crop you grow back at your farm and join the adventurer s guild to fight the threat in a nearby mine   say more would spoil the beauty of discover that little community on your own    the gameplay be straightforward   you take care of your plot of land to grow crop and that s about it   no end goal   no limit   no hand hold   you be leave to discover the beautiful life in pelican town bit by bit   since you can do pretty much everything you d want to   the control and mechanic be simple   but sometimes less be more    the one thing that I really like about the game be the passage of time   you get to enjoy all of the season   each of they come with its perk and disadvantage   you get to grow different crop base on the season you currently play through and the npc s also react differently   there s holiday to be celebrate   friendship to be discover and romance to be have    if you think you can enjoy a relax   slow pace game like stardew valley   then go ahead and buy it   do yourself a favour   altough the game might not be for everyone   it be certainly worth a try   but be careful   it may become quite addict      tl dr   a nice little game about life in a small town   with plenty of combat   farming   socializing and much more   build your farm from scratch and start make profit   try to solve the mystery behind pelican town or even get marry   truly the good experience for when you just want to unwind from a long day and play a nice little peaceful game   stardew valley have a bit of everything   for everyone
good quarantine game
   good fishing simulator       hour of pure fishing and it s not get boring at all
one of my favorite   stardew valley   how do I sum up one of my favorite game of all time   one of the first co op I play with my girlfriend   now wife    and one that give we so many good memory that its theme play as our wedding song    the story be simple   to get away from the hustle and bustle of life in the big city   you move to your late grandfather s farm in pelican town   stardew valley   however   after many year with no one there   the farm be in disrepair and it s your job to rebuild it into a homestead your old grandpa would be proud of    at first glance   stardew valley look like the quintessential farming sim   with the story and mechanic model after the legendary harvest moon   but it be so much more    aside from tend to crop and animal   you can forage   fish   mine   fight monster   explore   and interact with the citizen of pelican town   eventually   you can visit and explore several exotic location outside pelican town   each with unique puzzle   secret   and npc    it s truly crazy just how much there be to do in this game   and the good part be   you can do any of these thing in any order you want    or none at all   ultimately   it s up to you to decide what you want to do and how you want the game to progress   the game manage to strike that perfect balance of give you just enough structure so you re not run around like a headless chicken   but be also not be hand hold the entire time    the presentation be   quite frankly   delightful   the pixel graphic   character portrait   and soundtrack all work together to build a supremely cozy and relax vibe   the writing be surprisingly deep for this type of game   touch on some pretty dark theme without come off as tasteless    of course   not everything be perfect   the constant lack of energy in the early stage   before you have a few tool upgrade under your belt   can be pretty frustrating   the hard cap where your character pass out at   be feel like your mom call you in because it s past your bedtime   and for veteran player like I   who be return after a major update to check out all the new stuff   it can be a bit of a slog to go through the base game content again in a new playthrough    but all of these be minor gripe   especially when you consider that almost everything be make by one person   what eric barone do here truly boggle the mind    the real magic of stardew valley be that   at least for I   every time I start another playthrough   it feel like come home   and I can think of no high praise to give
I didn t really consider this game til   somewhere this year when a friend of mine buy I this game as a present   I expect this game to be a regular farming game where you repeat the same task of plant   harvest   sell   upgrade   repeat   with some npc that can give you some daily mission to help you progress fast   but this game have I completely immerse every time I boot it up   this game isn t only about farming and efficiency   but it s about live the life of a resident who just move into a new town to find a more fulfilling life   you re categorize as a farmer   but you also have side hobby and a social life as any other human being would   as a farmer   you plant a variety of seed   and care for your farm animal   you can then sell the produce to help the community thrive   accord to the grandma the grumpy old geezer like tulip   maybe you could give he the leave over tulip you keep in your chest   though if you re tired of farming   you could go collect sea shell for fun and sell they for a quick buck so you could buy that slick sword you be eye at early   or you could enjoy fish for salmon at a riverbank use that sick new fishing rod you just buy   though work can be tire   maybe go to the town festival can help you relax   that purple haired girl seem nice   maybe you could go befriend she by give she a purple geode you get early from mining   what I m try to get at be this game be a masterpiece that can pull you into it s immersive gameplay   I wouldn t say this game be for everyone   maybe you re into the satisfying feeling of mercilessly kill demon   or maybe you re a masochist that find it fun for all your progress be demolish by a minor mistake   but if you want a game that can help you be at ease and immerse you into play for hour   then this be a game I can       recommend to you

  this look like a fun and relax game   guess I ll try it out    yes   the game be very relaxing and extremely fun   but there be no   try   stardew valley   should you buy this game   then you well believe that you re go to spend at least          hour play it the first time around   it s not a waste of time   not at all   call it an investment of your time   when it come to this game    like   be synonymous to   addicted    so tell other that you   like   the game be the same thing as hide your addiction   so just accept it for what it be    stardew valley be also synonymous to   productiveness    no   it s actually the very definition of productivity   since you re go to wish you be as productive in real life as you be in game       it start with make your own character   choose the farm that you think look the good or most fun and also pick your companion pet   I m not go to spoil you on what   favorite thing   be about    during the first few day of stardew   I pretty much spend my time clean up the front yard of the farm   I just couldn t stand the sight of all that clutter and foliage on the ground and repeatedly getting stick between twig and rock be surprisingly infuriate   lewis   the mayor of the town   have give I     parsnip seed on my first day to help I with start my farm   but   cleaning   take a lot more energy out of my character than I expect   I find it to be quite enjoyable break all of those rock   cut down the tree and mow the grass   since it feel like I be actually clean for once   it wasn t until later that I would regret not start with the farm early   since that would have mean get more income in the early stage of the game   that s the thing with these type of game though   you be always go to regret make some of your decision   whether it s buy the wrong type of crop or plant too many crop and waste all your energy water those crop each and every morning   or you can be like I and do both of those example at once on top of plant your crop way too late into the season    anyways   I obviously get the material for clean the farm   but it s not like I know what to do with it   I end up just make a few chest   change their individual color and then I begin organize everything that I have gather   which be basically just plant fiber   twig   stone and then the occasional clay that I accidentally get from use the wrong tool on the wrong thing   after that   I finally decide I would head into town to try and interact with as many people as possible in one day   I keep get handwritten mail from character I have yet to actually meet each and every morning   so naturally I become more and more curious of the town and less interested in clean   it take I around      day before I begin to explore   but my farm be basically clear of anything that I might get stick on far down the line so I didn t really feel like I waste any time   I begin my exploration quest with go into random building and interact with every person I see   gus   the owner of   the stardrop saloon    alex   his sweet grandmother   evelyn and his very friendly grandpa   george that I give a dandelion to because I be curious as to what would happen if I give someone a gift    this be probably the bad gift I ve ever see   thank a lot    no   thank you george for that lovely comment    I also talk to pierre   the owner of the general store and his wife   caroline   and daughter   abigail    this be also when I use the starting money to buy more crop seed   tulip and parsnip because   why not   I remember think to myself     I then decide to head down south to look for this   willy   guy that say he be wait near the beach or something   on the way there I notice a trash can that I for some reason decide to try and interact with   I then learn something very interesting   interact with a trash can be the same as   search   the trash can and that naturally gross people out   this be how I meet a girl by the name of haley   she just kind of stand there stare at I while I be dig through the trash   and I be stare back at she   since it work so beautifully before   I decide to give she a gift as well because I didn t know if people would start to hate you for do   well   what I do   I would like to say that I   learn from my mistake    but that wasn t the case at all   I can t even say that as a joke   yes   you probably guess it right   I give she a dandelion   think that   she can t possibly hate they as much as george do right      ugh    that s such a stupid gift     thinking   haley must be relate to george    I reluctantly go down to the beach wonder if I should give willy   the fisherman guy a dandelion   as it turn out   I be to be the one on the receiving end   he give I his rod and man   I never think that such a simple fishing minigame could be so fun   I stand there for the rest of the day   waste away on my character s energy till I have no more    you feel sluggish from over exertion    it be the first time I be stay up past     in game and my character be walk slow than ever before   I already know beforehand that your character faint after    be   but the only way to make it back to bed in time would be to eat one of the fish I have catch to regain my stamina   but I wasn t go to break   bend the knee to a fish and eat it raw like gollum   I be go to sell they all no matter what   so yeah   I just faint and sell they all the next day at the cost of some extra energy   probably wasn t worth it   but I do get a few extra penny that I waste on buy more seed   I should ve save up for a well fishing rod      so anyways   good game
play this game for     minute to find out its be     hour non stop   very good game
this game have get I through many hard time   it s incredibly sweet and it feel like there be an endless amount of goal and thing to do   plus so many different way to play   will probably never get tired of it   
now   take a look at my hour   do I really need to write a review    yeah   I love this game that much    no game make I feel as safe and as welcome as stardew valley do   this game be my home   there s endless hour of content and project   and concernedape have be so incredibly dedicated in each new patch   I once buy four copy of the game in one day when multiplayer come out    please play stardew valley   it s a perfect example of indie game do right
I love people who treat gamer well   this game be make and still support by one man   be amazing   a good price that put s aaa s to shame    no pay extra to play bs here   no expensive ass dlc here   no overused promise and under deliver   much addictive    would recommend

I start off in stardew valley with a hoe   an overgrown plot of land   and a few parsnip   three year later I be a multimillionair expert spelunker with a       barrel artisan winery   a family   and the esteem of the entire town    well than real life   
good game   should buy   big fun   remove ur will to do anything else   d   only play if    you do not have a job   you do not go to school   you do not cook   you do not have responsibility   you do not have a life    just nominate it now
my son invite I to play a multi player game with he   I be not an experienced player so have someone along to show I the rope and to give I guidance be a big help   it make a great   date   with he every week   now I have my own farm and I love play this game   I have fun with the quest and make   friend   with the town folk   it be a fun and   mostly   relax way to spend time    the fishing be still hard so when I have a fish on the line   it isn t relax at all  
intro   stardew valley be easily one of the most amazing game I ve ever play   it let you enjoy the role of a farmer in a small town   socialize with its inhabitant   and witness an outstanding story that clearly clarify this game s genius    pro     I be a sucker for pixel graphic   and by all mean the spritework here be great and very well make   fun and insanely addict   in a very good way   you basically get suck into this game and spend countless hour play it because it s so incredibely fun   you get to socialize with the villager and get to know each and every one of their different   interesting personality   this be do by the friendship function in the game that be compose of ten heart   socializing unfold new dialogue   story and great scene regard each of they individually   eventually   there be villager that you can even marry   and set up a family with   explore endless floor with a satisfying amount of monster and loot   fishing mechanic be pretty much fun and challenge   but can be boring at time   very simple and comfortable interface and mechanic    plant and water plant manually can be a bit tiring at first   but shortly after you progress on your farm   these method be no long an issue since you can accomplish these automatically rather than manually   obviously this game wasn t make for this   so I can t blame the developer   but the fighting mechanic feel dull and rather unappealing   but you get use to it    this game be highly recommend   it be easily one of the good game I ve ever play
first a couple of admission   this game get compare a lot to the harvest moon series which I have never personally play   couple that with the fact that I have also never play a farming sim before and this be pretty much as pure of an opinion on the game itself as you can possibly get    now to the point   stardew valley be incredibly fun and have manage to hold my interest so much that I m play as much as I can lately   there be a bit of a learn curve if you be not familiar with anything from the harvest moon series   friend I know who have play that series and then stardew valley clue I into a lot of little thing I didn t know about and likely wouldn t have figure out until I read about it somewhere later   but what make this game even more impressive to I be how a single dev take so much inspiration from something he clearly love   mixed in load of player feedback   and build something truely special   I wish I have be one of the people that learn about this game early on so I could have watch it grow   no pun intend     I also can t help but love the retro art style of classic rpgs   yet with the modern polish and bright color that make it stand out as still be something new   I can t help but wonder if chucklefish help concerned ape out with some of that consider how much it remind I of the art style use in their game starbound   but either way it s get a surprisingly good level of detail to it with lot of character   as far as how the game play   I find myself love the simple yet challenging approach of level your five core skill and learn the good technique to maximize the efficiency and profit of your farm   you start off struggle to make everything work in that first year and by your second you really start to feel like you know what to do now    the story be also simple but with a lot of charm   even though pelican town be small it always feel like there be something new to discover about the people who live there   while it can take a lot of time and effort to befriend everyone it become worth it to see how they all interact together and how much of an impact your character can make in their life   it s the ultimate expression of a lively small town community and look out for your fellow man   something I think a lot of we lose sight of sometimes in this digital age   but let s not forget the symbol of modern change that take form in joja corporation   a megacorporation look to monopolize pelican town   you can either decide to help they out   for a price   and increase the town s reliance on joja corp   or instead work to restore the town s community center and promote local business and interaction   decline joja further business opportunity in the area   it s a powerful underlying message to the whole game and something many can feel passionate about one way or the other    lastly I need to mention the price   for all the hour I ve sink into this game already and will likely continue to add in the future   the      price tag feel like a steal   I can t help but highly recommend this game at full price because if you be a fan of this type of sandbox rpg farming sim you will easily justify the cost twice over   I actually buy the game for a friend because it be affordable and something I could recommend to anyone and I know my friend would enjoy it   while I m sure it s bind to end up on sale when the initial hype die down   please don t be someone that wait specifically for that to happen   this game be worth every cent and doesn t cost any more than a month of game time for any mmo out there   if you be sincerely interested and have the money   don t wait    tl dr   this game be freak amazing and you should get it
give I money
   if the world be against leah then I be against the world
when I first see this game I think it might be kind of similar to the game   rune factory   frontier   which I have play on the wii   I ve eagerly await a port for pc but as of yet it currently can only be play on pc use an emulator   stardew valley give off some very similar vibe though so I think maybe it might be close enough to sort of fill that same gap    the game start out simple enough   your grandfather leave you a farm and you need to work to repair it and get it up and run again   you chop log   break rock   till soil   plant seed and harvest your crop   there s a lot of room to play around with your farm and where you want to place thing   there s also a forage aspect which help encourage exploration of your surrounding too   the game be more than just a farming sim though   it also have rpg element and you can battle monster in the mine that in turn drop loot you can use or sell   in addition to that it have some adventure game aspect such quest and some fairly light puzzle   you can date and marry certain people in the town and even have two kid   later in the game you can even forge your own weapon and equipment and add specific power up to they    I grow up on pixel graphic so I find the graphic to be somewhat nostalgic feeling   the animation be fairly simple and the character sprite very   d but the character themselves   not so much   each character have a bit of a backstory and unique character trait you get to know as you build friendship point   at certain level of friendship you re give the treat of special little cut scene   you get to make choice on how you respond to the cut scene too   sometimes it can help your relationship or hurt it   this add quite a bit of story element to the game    part of the beauty of this game be that you can play it in so many way   if you just want to have a calm farming experience   grow crop   play around with aesthetic or optimal functionality in your build   then you can play it that way   the music in the game somehow manage a great balance of calm and upbeat   if you want a little more excitement you can delve deep in the different mine and battle a variety of monster and collect and craft well gear   if you like adventure then you ll probably want to work on complete quest and solve the puzzle   if you re more into story you ll probably enjoy make friend with everyone and explore their personality   really   there s a little something for everyone and enough content that if you get bored there s something else to try    in the early game it really feel like complete the community task mount to a climax   it s easy little goal to attain and strive for but once you finish the community center that s really just the beginning of the game   you can unlock other mine   a desert   and an island   the game be much more expansive than you will first anticipate and it s possible that the developer may release future expansion to bring even more content and explorable area   the game do have a sort of   end   in which you ll see a special cut scene but you can keep play on so the game doesn t ever truly end   you can also create a new character to play again from the beginning   there be different farm type that present different challenge and benefit which make for a little replay ability    in addition to different map you can also play this game in co op mode with friend   I don t personally like multi player experience   I prefer solo adventure   but I do like that if you choose to play this way each character can have their own house and while you can work together   you can also go off and do your own thing   you aren t limit to the host s farm or experience and guest can upgrade their cabin   get marry   and essentially experience everything the game have to offer    there be really only two thing I dislike about this game   first   there s the save function   you can only save by go to sleep   or end the day by fall asleep outside your home bed or   die   in the mine   you can t actually die you just get beat to within inch of your life apparently     sleeping end the day and your game progress be save   however   I often find that I have to leave my game in the middle of a day when I don t have time or the ability to finish my day or even run to my bed so I can save   instead   I have to open the menu   which pause the game   and then either just leave it run in the foreground or if I have to do something on my computer   let it run in the background till I could get back to the game   so   for example   at the time of write this review   steam have          hour log play this game   however   between my two save file I only have about      hour log in game   so   it spend about half the time sit open in the background on my computer simply because I could hit a save button and continue later    the second thing I didn t like be the fishing mini game   I ve play plenty of game that have fish mini game in they and they be all similar but all have their own unique flair     this one be the bad fishing mini game I ve ever play   maybe other people find it easy but I couldn t get how to catch fish   there s something to do with pattern and click at the right time but I completely fail at it every time   the only thing that make fishing redeemable be actually a mod that let I skip the mini game portion   while I don t necessarily advocate mod   I find the game partially unplayable because of this mini game and it be really ruin my personal experience with play the game   the mod make the game playable and fun again    mod be actually one of the thing that for some player could be a real plus side to the game   stardew valley have a fairly large modding community with mod for everything from change the npc s dialogue avatar to skip fishing mini game to add elevator to create new expand area to explore   if you find yourself too frustrated with an aspect of the game   there s probably a mod for it   if you love mod for game you ll love this game    the last thing I d like to touch on be the game s achievement   there s     of they which be a fair amount and most will unlock naturally over time with normal gameplay   but there be several collection base achievement that you have to work for   many of those require a lot of hour of game play   for example   if you want to catch all the fish you win t be able to do it unless you fish in every season   some require reach maximum friendship which can take a lot of time to build   and of course other require you to get a huge sum of money   collectible item be gain through rng drop so even if you do everything right you could be do it a long time to get those drop you need   for completionist   like I   that can be very frustrating and it s a big part of why I have to put in about      hour to get all the achievement   it could be a lot less or even more depend on your luck with the rng    overall   this game be a gem   I don t usually recommend game at full retail price   but I d say this one be actually worth it

homeless man be nice

welcome to the   game of the year    seriously   this game be honestly the good game I have play in year   like I can t express how much this game be so heartwarming   love   feel amazing   fun   replayable and the list of adjective that I could use range on and on and on and on   this game be literally the good game I ve play in age   and if you don t do yourself the pleasure of play it   at least watch video on it because this game deserve the most attention and most amount of love towards it    start off with the story   you be an office worker who work for the   joja corporation    sit in front of your pc and rot away along with the life around you   the amount of people you see in the starting intro who be waste their life away be honestly quite depressing and doesn t even match the tone for the game at all   this game use the form of a   tonal shift   which basically start the game off with such a dark tone   but enlighten it when you get to your bright   vibrant and amazingly joyus farm   the story of the game be that your grandfather give you an envelope to only open when you need a break from your rural life   thus the game begin    you be introduce to your farm by the lovely robin   she tell you that the farm look kinda trashy and laugh at you   she may seem like an evil girl now   but she turn out to be such a lovely girl   now   whilst I m talk about the people I think it be a good idea to talk about the townsfolk   I honestly feel such a bond and an actual care between all the villager and all the people that you encounter   they all seem unique and some of they seem to have such a troubled past and many have dark secret which may be discover as you progress through the game    this be yet another amazing example of how the game make you feel like you fit in and bond   you talk to the villager and have the option to gift they    gift per week   the villager may love it or they may despise it   and will make it quite apparent if they hate it   as you go up the heart scale   you will unlock cutscene between the villager and they may send you meal recipe in the mail   I   myself   I have never fit in well with people   I would be the person in school   and I still be   the person who would get leave behind or be force to walk behind the person in front   jist of the story   I be never popular   you re probably wonder where I m go with this   and well   this game have make I feel like I fit in and that I be actually part of a community of people that care about I   it s a heartwarming feeling and make I feel so happy and just make I feel a feeling that I ve never feel in a video game    enough of the sappy stuff   let s talk about the basicness of this game   yes   the basic   I know the basic of some game may be quite boring but this game just do it   this game start you off with tool and just let you live off the land and allow you to remove the tree   rock and other forageable item which may be lie around your farm   this game be literally your big   fat sandbox and it allow you to do whatever the hell you want to do with it   the game make I feel like I be free and that the game isn t restrain I to do anything and isn t stop I from do anything   stardew valley do an amazing job of let you feel like this be your house so you can do what you want   this game be all about you and make you feel like it s your farm and you can do it   I may be sound repetitive   but I need to enforce that this game be your oyster    so   you ve probably hear that this game be like a cross between   harvest moon   and   animal crossing    and it really be   this may sound like it s a bad thing   but if you ve play either of those game you ll realise that those game be extremely good and make you feel like you re free and have the ability to do anything   plant your crop   will get into this soon    be extremely relaxing and be just such a great time waster   everything in this game just feel so amazing and be just   I m at a loss for word without repeat myself    onto what it s like to actually plant the crop   plant crop be a great way of make money in stardew valley   be if for your own personal use or be it for money   you use your hoe on the ground to till the land   you then place some sort of seed into the tilled land and then water it   proceed to water it every morning and soon you will have an amazing   bountiful farm fill with delightful look crop and more colour than the eye can make out   you don t have to farm in the game   unless you want to actually follow the basic premise of the game   duh   but there be other alternative which I can not for the life of I remember right now    so   there s fish in this game   be you surprised   do the word fishing strike fear into your vein due to other game have such dastardly and terrible fishing minigame   well   release your fear   the fishing minigame in this game be actually bloody brilliant   the fishing minigame be where you control a green bar and keep it on the fish   if you keep it on the fish for a certain amount of time   congrat   you ve catch you re first fish   and probably not your last    if you manage to not

the chill game you can play   there s no way to mess up in this game   you see that farm   you don t have to improve it if you don t want to   maybe all you want be to fish and hang out with abigail   or maybe you just want to fight slime   till you pass out   hell   maybe you just want to get drunk and bring the wizard present   you do you   dog   this game ain t go to judge    there s just so much to do in this game   in the absence of a contemporary animal crossing   it s easy to see why it s be such a massive success   what it do be basically take all the heart and spirit of ac and place it within a more relaxed version of harvest moon s infrastructure   that s just the basic setup though   the real genius be in the way the gameplay be pace   take a cue from civilization s   one more turn   mantra   this game be play over a succession of in game day for which you have a limited amount of stamina to carry out the many different little action that you can take   these day   essentially bite sized segment of gameplay   gradually add up to shape a deeply personal experience that feel very unique to the player   that s the killer app here   your farm   your village   your relationship   and your trajectory along the season all feel tie up to the decision you take and the activity you choose to do or not do   day by day   you can breeze through day if you want   just pick up crop and sleep before noon even hit   or you can take it slow and optimize each day   cramp in as many activity as you can with your limited stamina   it s all up to you    this game will also take you by surprise in the way that it can engage you   personally   I be worried at first because farm building never really enthuse I as a mechanic   in fact   the whole aspect of decorate improve your house in ac be something I never connect with either    but this game have so much more than just keep your farm   it s get a good fishing system   which I greatly appreciate   it s get a mine to explore and engage in combat   it have a museum for you to fill in with fossil and other tidbit   it have a house full of mini challenge each with its own reward that will keep you busy for week    and then there s the date   my god   this game have some good writing   the denizen of stardew valley be a family you ll come to know very well   and each one of they have an interesting line you can follow as you strengthen your friendship with they   as you can imagine   the progression for these relationship be pretty straightforward   you just gift they stuff    but the real meat be in the little scene that play when you hit the milestone in the relationship   some of they will stay with I for a long time    there s just so much value here   it truly feel like an evolution in the genre   with its more palpable and personal progression and the way it doesn t string you around or punish you for any way of use your time   you ll play this game and wish you could have this simple   tranquil life   consider the game s intro and mission statement   I call that a home run

at what point can you write a review for stardew valley   can you ever finish the game   would you ever want to   for reason that be hard to explain   this be one of the good game I ve ever play    this title be about nothing except escapism   you will trade your life   ideally on a temporary basis   for the life of your self design character in stardew valley   in the game   you escape your boring cubicle job to live a simple life as a farmer in a close community that be struggle to stay relevant in an increasingly conglomerate dominate western society   the game manage to argue an anti corporate america   wal mart be bad   but not inherently evil   agenda in such a real way that be impossible to ignore   all the while provide you the opportunity to choose for yourself   and unabashedly encourage you to embrace capitalism to maximize the value of your labor and intellect   the game succeed in this alternative reality in much the same way the sim capture so many gamer   heart   in stardew it seem you be able to achieve thing that perhaps you can not achieve in real life   however   you will leave the game feel happy   uplifted   and hopeful    beneath this existentialism be a day to day deluge of strangely addict activity   mine   farm   make friend   help the community   cook   craft equipment   manage your finance   fish   oh how I love to fish    forage   ranch   etc   etc      by provide more structure   than say minecraft s survival mode   the game succeed in guide we something much more fulfil    the aesthetic   think of it as an improved     bit legend of zelda   you will soak it in   it be my phone s background   you will learn to love the bright color and simple sprite while despise the grittiness of real life   the music   it s so simple it should drive you mad   but it s so happy it will soothe your soul    read discussion   you will hear of gamer who be self treat their anxiety   depression   mental illness   there be something very special about this game   there be something very important about this game   it will brighten your day and provide you with a measure of joy   the sad part be   I feel like I might be ready to move on     
stardew valley     what can I say that hasn t already be say   it be a true spiritual successor to a game I never play   call harvest moon   first thing first     if you love harvest moon   please go buy this right now and dig in   if not   hold on and hear I out   then go buy the game      the game have you inherit a farm and build a life for yourself on the farm   you build relationship and explore in the new community that you be throw into   the core of the game be base around a daily cycle   everyday you have to decide what you be go to accomplish each and every day   this come down to farming   fishing   explore   mining   and shopping   but the season put pressure on you to handle your farm correctly and time everything down to the day   it get to the point you want to just spend one more   day   of in game time play     much like civilization have the just one more turn phenomenon associate with it    overall   there be very little to be upset about in this game   I would recommend this to anyone that want a nice and relaxing game   this go into my gold tier of game   and I can t find any reason not to give stardew valley a         it be honestly worth it just to pay for the game at regular price

stardew valley may look to be a lay back kinda game   huh   that might be true   but for some people   like myself   this game will suck you into the vortex like a hyper hydraulic toilet on the turbo rinse cycle option    now   I have very little experience in this genre of harvest moon lookin   farm game   but it s hard for I to imagine that they get much well than this   there s just so much to do that it s hard to fathom   you ve get to clean up your farm so that you get a nice open spot to plant some little potato seed   get to grow those little stink egg up right quick to make a nice buck at pierre s store   but what cha go to do while you re wait for the vegetable   hmm   I don t know   you could get a fishing pole from ol   willy and catch some salty sardine or maybe you wanna go into the mine and search for sparkly rock crystal while you fend for your life in the dank depth of the earth    but this be only the beginning of what s on the agenda   you can build some animal coop and milk some cow   build a stable an   ride a horse   befriend the local and maybe meet a waifu or husbando   you can rebuild the community center   cook up delicious pizza and give they to your buddy   maybe even sniff around in the open field look for grape and then eat they   the choice be yours and the pace at which you take it be yours to decide as well    great music   great style   lot to do   and a heaping helping of getting suck right into the vortex of no return   this be what stardew valley have to offer   give it a shot if you re in the mood for lose yourself in the endless expanse of farm fresh manure and infinite anchovy    to sum thing up   I d give stardew valley a solid scoring of   outta control like a bull go ape   thank for read
my favorite game of all time   great balance of repeat farm activity and large goal   and some of the good support for mod I ve ever see   utterly charming
I m up to      mod and my game still hasn t implode so I d say the farm be go amazing   love it here
to think that stardew be make by a single developer   the breath and depth of the content be amazing   even if you use the wiki to somewhat   cheat   and find secret   there be still a seemingly endless amount of content to discover   aside from all of the secret and character   it s nice to just walk around the stardew valley and escape into another virtual life   I highly recommend this game for anyone from a casual gamer to someone into more resource optimization
average stardew valley fan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
stardew valley be the perfect game for a rainy day with a cup of hot coffee   no   but really   this be the most comfy and heartwarming game you can find    I m a sucker for pixel artwork and farming game   so stardew valley please two of my preference   as well as go all the way beyond that and reach a really high spot on the list of my favourite game   in term of content it s pretty rich   with lot of different thing to do   this be definitely the most enjoyable farming sim available on this platform      overall feel of the game be extremely comfortable and fun     lovely artwork and soundtrack     a lot of different villager to befriend or even romance     farming   craft   mining   fishing and other fun thing to do     various event and festival to participate in     expandable house   which you can decorate and make extra comfy     different farm type     plenty of various building to get onto your farm   as well as really cute farm animal     endless hour of fun   this game be very addict    overall   I highly recommend stardew valley to anyone who enjoy farming simulator or look for a cosy game

I once play this game for thirty seven hour straight   I log my first hundred hour within a week   I don t even know how to articulate what about this game make I like it   eventually   you do escape   but you always slightly lament the stardew shape void in your life   a part of I doesn t know what to do anymore now   and I m not sure I ll get it back    also you will actually fall in love with your spouse if you choose one   like   you will talk about they   it s a problem          give I an existential crisis that I live with every day
the village have a satanic cult kinda vibe   I can feel their malicious intent with each line of dialogue   there s something wrong with they   they be not like normal people   do not trust they   the sign be everywhere   the god they pray to be nothing like the one we know   its something dark      evil and corrupt   please do not trust the mayor   he s try to deceive you   he know why you be there   he know who you be   he might look like a nice old man   but he s no long human    once you arrive you can not leave   once you take the bus its a one   way   trip   ever wonder why villager always   casually find you   and drop you at the clinic every time you don t go sleep by   be     because they do not   they be always watch you   they hide in the wood wait for you   wait for you to make a mistake   or perhaps wait for the moment you go to sleep so they can perform their satanic ritual without your knowledge   nothing be what it seem   please remember that   you have no ally and no one you can trust   they deem you an outsider   a danger to their unnerving secret agenda   to the terrifying truth about they    when the community center be complete   there will be a sacrifice   and it will be you   if anyone else know about this game s evil secret   please leave a comment in this review   the more we be the more we can spread the truth

when I first meet abigail she tell I she d love explore the overgrown field and forest of the abandon farm as a kid   and that she be sad to hear that they be go to be cut down    so I leave half of the farm as wilderness   because I couldn t break her heart like that    it must have work   because a couple year later we get marry         good alternative life    update        new content keep come   so happy to see the game still get love    
stardew valley be a great game    don t be put off by the retro graphic or lack of gun and shiny fast pace action   if you want those then chance be   you may miss the point of the game   the game for I be almost a little like inception      as one of the reason I game be to escape   to get away from the stress and pressure of everyday life   work and other   in stardew valley   you do just that    the opening cut scene reveal a character who be unhappy with a dead end job and seemingly no prospect   until they find a letter from their late grandfather    bequeath they a farm in stardew valley   something he himself go and escape to in his lifetime   and you go   and you farm   you learn what work   what doesn t   you meet people   you make friend   and if you work hard at it   maybe more   you go fight monster   you learn to fish   you help people   but you be never bore   except maaaaaaaybe in winter   as there be   always   thing to be do on a farm   and there s plenty to explore as well    the thing I like about the game be the layer in here   as you become invest in your character you learn about the villager you ve move near to   they each have their own backstorie    which you find out both directly and indirectly   they each have thing they love   thing they hate   people they like too   it s a reminder what life   could    and in the past in some place   be   be like    and it have a   lot   of replayability value    yes you ll go back in understand the farming and some of the mechanic   but that give you freedom to make different choice   and concentrate on other thing      so move on up and settle yourself in to stardew valley and regain some lose sanity and some hope
if stardew valley have    million fan   I would be    of they if stardew valley have    fan   it would be I if stardew valley have no fan   it be because I be dead as long as I live I will love stardew valley

goood relaxing game   let I live my dream of be a gay farmer
to be honest the main reason that I buy this game be the fact that I want something with very low requirement so I can play it during my summer vacation in my rather old laptop   I never expect that the game be so good       despite the simple    retro graphic and music it be highly enjoyable and addictive   the gameplay be so relaxing and peaceful   even the grind be mysteriously enjoyable   great and funny character and a very nice progression    this game be a great value for money and be highly recommend for all age
the incredibly short review be   if you love yourself   you should at least try this game    now for the long one    I believe when this first come out   I get it as a gift from a friend   and be assure that it be similar   yet super different   to a very beloved game of mine   harvest moon   honestly   I didn t touch it for year   view most indie game at the time as waste of money   especially when I be work and in school    then   I stop work   and find myself in an incredibly bad spot mentally   my eat disorder kick in   I be diagnose with suicidal depression   with suddenly too much time on my hand and no energy to take up a new hobby   it be my partner who ask if I d play   he himself pick it up around this time   and it be one soft encouragement of   you already own it   just try it   that push I to start that first save file    game play wise   it s everything I wish harvest moon have be   dynamic movement   a simple ui   clear goal and a sense of progression that doesn t ever feel forced or artificial   farming be one part of it   so if that s not your jive   there be a magnitude of option to make money and grow what I fondly think of as my other life   you never have to get marry   although to have adorably pixelate child a spouse be require   and if you d like to live the lone wolf lifestyle   it allow it   you never have to make friend   unless you like finish quest   which some of we don t    the combat be smooth and clean   most time   as you level up   weak thing get easy and the challenge pose to you grow ever more difficult   this mechanic mean that if you like the combat   not I    it doesn t seem to get boring   even after level      reward be abundant   treasure and artifact and mineral that be need to get some of the well gear in the game    however   there be a luck system   so be warn about try to hunt for iridium on a bad luck day   the fortune teller give you no lie   and it s   not worth it try to tempt their reading    crop be simple   if not a little tedious in the first year   when you likely have no sprinkler or good fertilizer   honestly   I m the type to plan out the farm from day one   but many other throw seed into large clump and hey    whatever work for you   just get use to the sound of run water every time you use the watering can   many bathroom break in the beginning   trust I   crow win t be an issue after you figure out scarecrow   and as soon as you can craft fertilizer   start basic and put it under everything   I mean it   crop just die sometimes and when you re like I and want that community center do quickly and efficiently   you ll need every one of they in the first year   animal be cute   way too cute   and from personal experience in the first year or two they ll make you more money quick than crop    speak of the community center   or if you re a opportunistic capitalist who doesn t care about small town business   joja mart warehouse   finish it will bring you joy for about ten minute   until you realize that it do literally nothing and no one use it   waste of so many resource and your actual hard earn gold    fishing be a pain until suddenly you re good at it and your left click finger be train on a hair trigger   crab pot be useless and I hate they   and there s something so satisfying about spend half an in game day forage for berry in the summer that it s hard for I to describe it in word    this be a game that be make for downtime   and in my personal belief   do it in a way that s in no way boring or overdone   it s reinvent the   farming sim   game to the point where everything else feel lack   it require little effort if you don t want to give it   or will lend itself to meticulous planning of crop and other money make strategy   it s a game that I can sit down with at work for a quick break   or throw myself into for a weekend   either way   in the word of marie kondo   it certainly do spark joy
I will be the first to admit that when I see this game float around steam a week or two before its release I be kind of skeptic about it   the art and pixel style throw I for a loop   and while I love harvest moon style game and rune factory     I wasn t too sure about spend money on this game   I ve be burn before and I be wary of try it   it be about     I think a day of or after the release and I notice it have a small sale and I figure    well   I just get pay   and it might be a good distraction until I find another game to play        so   uhm   you might have notice I have     hour of playtime   so I figure I d well write my thought on why I love this game    music         everyone know that what helps make a game great be the music it have   I be immediatly suck in by the music   it remind I so much of the harvest moon game I play that have such amazing music   if there be a soundtrack available   maybe there be   I would be willing to drop money on it    control        the control of the game be not the bad I ve encounter   but I feel it could be improve a bit   honestly   if I hadn t find the control option this would have have a       review instead   the   show tool hit location   be not automatically select so it lead to some frustrating moment just try to till the ground   the combat be a bit frustrating since you have to turn your character in order to swing the sword in the exact direction it have to go in   but after some practice I ve iron out the kink    storyline         oh my god guy   this   this right here help make the game for I   its honestly what I have be sorely miss in other farming game like harvest moon   its not just   till the land   plant the seed   make the cash    no   this be much more then that   I would love to go into detail   but I don t want to give anything away to people who want to come in blind    character         these loveable character have their own flush out hope   fear   and dream   they have their strength   their weakness   and their own personality   not one character be the same   their life experience make they what they be and their background helped shape they   but at the same time they grow   they adapt   they change   the more you interact with they the more impact you have on their life   its amazing    character customization         what many harvest moon game lack until recently be be able to customize your farmer   however stardew have by far the good I have see   around     different hair style   over      different shirt to chose from   skin color   eye color and hair color   you want to make yourself look like the hulk   get your green on and hulk up for some farming   want to be a vampire   a demon   you can be anything    I would add more but honestly I be a little under the weather as I m write this and I m rapidly run out of energy   so a last few tid bit for you guy and gal consider this game    this game do not end in an xx amount of year   you can keep play for as long as you want    it doesn t matter what gender you be   you can romance any of the     available   be you a gal that like other gal   yep   you can woo   date   and marry they   be you a dude that want to smooch   woo   and marry other dude   you can do that too   guess what else you can do   if you re unable to have kid the traditional way you can adopt   you can have a family   or if you don t want a kid you don t have to have one   at least   I m pretty sure you don t have to     all in all        game that I plan on play for a very long time

one sentence   if you like harvest moon   you will love stardew valley
I start a new farm and before I realize it I ve be play for    hour straight and don t feel like I waste my time   I ve never be a huge fan of these type of game but stardew valley be so addict and fun and I fall in love with it    if there s even a con I guess it would be that concernedape be make this solo so update be slow   however I hear that should be change soon with the hiring of a team to work on the game   finger cross          farming addiction
this isn t just a farming simulator   it s an anti depressant simulator                             l       x                                                          
hey to everyone who s read my review right now      if you would check my game here on steam you would notice that farming game like stardew valley aren t that type of game I normally play   in my opinion in the most farming game you be bored after maybe an hour or two   but in fact   stardew valley isn t boring   not at all   but let s start at the beginning   when I start to play this game for an hour or a lil bit more I get really bored to be honest   the problem be that I didn t know how this game work   I didn t know how to go fishing   farming   or well say I do not know how I have to organize my farm that all would work    and this be very annoying   so I would add only one thing to that game     it would be really helpful so that you know what your first step should be   but of course    I have to say there be some guide here on steam who can help you a little bit too   but I think it s well if the game would explain and show you all      and after I learn about the important thing in stardew I have really fun to create my own farm   the big difference between stardew valley and other farming game be that you can do lot of other thing than only to be on your farm   for example   you can do mining   you have in this game your   own mine    and its really cool in there because there be a lot of floor     it feel a little bit like in the old pok kom dungeon games   d   and every floor be get hard then of course    in that mine be monster you have to fight      fishing make very fun too   something that I really like too be that you can interact with lot of npc s   you can fall in love with one of they   or everybody       and get marry    and have your own family too     or maybe you be unfriendly as hell so that noone notice you and you will be forever alone    it s your desicion   p   but yeah really   it s so cool that you can get really good friend with they   also every day you talk to they they say different thing etc    its really awesome   I could say a lot of other good thing about that game like that you have a libary where you can donate artifact you find in that game and get cool stuff for your farm   or that you have different festival per year etc   so what I really want to say be   even you don t like farming game   like I either   you should really try this game   you will probably love it after a few hour like I      that s all     enjoy your day
everyone who have ever enjoy harvest moon   this be your game   everyone who want a bit of relaxation   this be your game   everyone who want a game   where a single developer have really put his heart into   this be your game    I can safely say that neither the     hour I ve put into this   nor the      postive review   nor the     euro       tag be a mistake   if you re still uncertain   just take a look on the broad variety of youtube video out there   and then decide
I ve         about     hour into this game at this point   I can honestly say that it have more charm than any of the more recent harvest moon game   I grow up with   m fomt and btn and this game have I as hooked as those two do   the event feel organic   character feel fleshed out and diverse and there be always thing to do   the depth of this game be astounding   you can harness lightning bolt and sprinkler and mine cart fast travel    the list go on    fishing be theraputic   farming and design your land be theraputic   speak to the villager and watch event be engage   this game be just an incredibly comfortable   addictive experience and I would fully recommend it to anyone
lovely game
there s sex
this be truly a labor of love    recommend for anyone who ever even slightly enjoy any builder game
here I will leave the cat   friend who pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up                l       x                                                          
love this game   have be move away from competitive   stressful game as I like pursue relax gaming experience and this fit the bill   plenty to do and very satisfying
tired of early access   love harvest moon   like life sim   want a relax   content fill game for cheap    if you can say yes to any of these point   give this game a chance   it s great
get a cat here   friend pass by can touch she and click like to pet she once                    l       x                                                         
you can farm you can get marry you can fish you can kill tree you can mine you can look after chicken you can look after duck you can look after cow you can look after sheep you can make jam you can make wine you can make mayonaise you can live in a house you can upgrade your house you can sell grass for stupid amount of money you can help people you can give people gift every character be unique every character be special and like different thing you can marry anyone    male or female    this game have no force storyline allow you to do as you wish I like this game you will like this game
I wasn t sure about this game at first   a lot of thing seem really off about it   like the fast timer compare to modern hm game   but it actually end up be able to rival even the new hm game and anyone who lack a nintendo console can just pick this game up and basically get the good of the experience offer by harvest moon   animal crossing fan will also find enjoyment in decorate your house and fill up the museum   and rune factory fan will enjoy the mine and subsequent risk to reward gameplay they provide   in addition to all this   you do not have to make friend with your         neighbor just to get tool anymore which be probably the good feature of this game   you can basically be a hermit   never get marry   and never talk to anyone and you will not miss out   you can even complete one of the two main story   you can choose which one to complete   without any           socializing like the hm games force on you   but   if you do want to get marry   you can even have the option of marry the same sex which no hm game to date have offer    the one complaint I have so far be the way the game save   save in game today should be a convenient and accessible feature   this isn t the    s when battery be some expensive commodity and game be a lot more involved than they use to be   but this game have a very rigid way of only save your game between day and you basically have to go through an entire day before you can save again   when you re use to hm game both offer you a diary in your house to save mid day or even get the option to skip saving   come in handy when try to pray to rngesus for rainy weather    this can be pretty jarring and I do not understand why the game be like this   all I can figure be the dev prioritize stop people from cheat over offer well convenience and assurance to the majority of people wh don t   and that be a poor choice   this isn t a pvp game   that be the only time where make design choice solely to prevent people from cheat   even at the expense of legitimate play   be valid   and this be a single player game basically beg the question   who care    when someone want to cheese it   it isn t like the ai have feeling
can a game be therapeutic   I haven t play long enough to learn any more than the basic   but I m love it   it s kind of a complete opposite to a lot of my other game    very relax   I m very grateful to have         this one as a gift   because I m not sure I would have buy it myself   it s an oasis
this game get I coochie
   wow
just one more day and then I ll stop   
simply put   one of the good game ever   more charm   depth   and intrigue in this pixelate town than I ve experience from almost any other game   also   the developer keep improve and add to this remarkable game
make my depression go bye bye for a little while   literally therapeutic
it s a great time sink   especially if you re depress   like I   and need something to distract you from everyday woe and stress   really easy to get suck in    edit   not sure how this gain so much traction   but I appreciate the kind comment   to everyone else    please be kind to each other
stardew valley create by one developer by the name of concernedape   be a game similar to harvestmoon animal crossing etc finally with a similar gameplay create for the pc but be big and well   it isn t about the   d graphic that make this game genre great but rather the gameplay and the amount of content this game come with   this game be a piece of gem among indie game and I rarely say this when it come to indie since there be so many   might not be your cup of tea if you do not enjoy that type of series but then again that be unless you also own a console   if you never try this series

dive into one of the list content above and really try it out you might be too late for that refund      buck for hundred of hour here and also multiplayer come later on   you tell I if that s worth the value   I ve spend over      hour so far
most of the hour I have in this game have be spend play with my girlfriend   its some of the good bonding time we have   we legit spend at least    hour straight design the interior of our home and we still giggle when we get into the same bed together   she s a completionist and have totally show I aspect of the game I never know exist cause I will literally just farm the entire time I play   I love this game   the multiplayer be a huge boost to it and I m so glad to have a game I can play with my girl   she s very picky about game she play   luckily we be both huge fan of harvest moon   so naturally I have to tell she about this game and its just awesome   if you get a significant other and you like to get seriously grossly cute with eachother and enjoy game like harvest moon   play stardew valley together   you will not regret it    edit   hadn t touch this game in quite some time   then my girlfriend come at I all excited cause there be a huge update   so we play again   have more fun arrange our new home on that new island   not finish yet though   but yay for more bonding time   again   if you and your significant other like harvest moon type game   get this game and play together
so   let s just start this off with say that this one guy manage to create a game which not only have more depth and personal involvement than most of the aaa title come out   even in        but have manage to keep this game update and add a duodecillion new item   asset and npc into the game early this onth   december          this game let you be what you want to be   and reward continue gameplay with even more depth   be a farmer and grow row upon row of crop   be a miner and go spelunkling   be a fisherman and go fish for so godawful many type of thing you can fish up   you can even be a lumberjack if that so fancy you    the people you meet   the quest you get into   the sheer amount of thing to do   you will not put this game away for the first while   once you re hook   you re hook deep    the graphic only add to the pleasantry of the game   bring both a fun way to do shade and object   but do so in a retro manner so both young and old can play along   and the sound be contribute equally as much to make the experience of play this game so much more eventful and amusing    it be warmly recommend and with as much effort as have be put into the game and with as many hour as you ll likely end up spending on this game   it s more than well worth the money spend purchase the game

I wish people in real life be as friendly as in this wonderful game    
I ll admit   I insult the game when I first take a glimpse at it   the gameplay look pretty boring and it make I want to snooze   but it be a completly different story   not literally   once I purchase the game    I be convince to   try out   the game before I judge it   and with my lunatic of a mind   I buy the game to try it out   the review don t do it any wrong   I absolutely love the game   the concept of the game be that you   escape   the modern lifestyle of work to live in the countryside where your grandfather once own a farm pass down to you   I can tell you   I honestly feel warp into the game myself   as if stardew valley be where I go when I want to   escape   the world around I    the game allow you to marry npc   own pet   do quest   farm   sleep   mine in cave   kill monster   basically everything you could think of in the average life style plus a little sprinkle of monster here and there   I don t think I have ever feel this close to a game since forever          I would recommend this to anybody   everywhere to give it a try   it s worth the price

this game be make by one dude   one person make this piece of art   buy this game
this game     this game will suck the life out of you one season at a time and you will love it    if you be look for a relaxing farming simulator   this be it   if you be lookig for a relationship simulator   this be it   if you be look for a procedurally generate dungeon crawler   this be it   if you be look for an exploration game   this be it   if you be look for a fun fishing game   this be it   if you be look for a game that make you feel good and frustrated at the same time   this be it
I haven t be this addicted to a game since terraria first come out    it s a harvest moon like where you move out of the city and into a cabin   from almost nothing   you can slowly build up a giant farm   but that s not all there be to do   you can also forage   fish   make friend in town   or explore the monster infest mine    I don t think I ve ever before see an indie game where all of the sound   art   writing   and gameplay element work together so perfectly   seriously   it s that good
live out the farming life you ve secretly always want    stardew valley be a farming and social simulator develop by concernedape   in stardew   you decide to quit your boring job in the city to move out to a farm you recently inherit from you grandfather   just outside pelican town   the farm have be overrun by nature after it be leave empty and unloved for many year   your job be to turn it around and start make money out of it   you re not alone in pelican town and you ll meet many of the townspeople in the first few day   pelican town rarely see new people move in so it s a big deal when you turn up    I ve never play any of the game stardew be compare to   harvest moon and the like   and so I take a bit of a gamble when I buy this game   thankfully I be not disappointed and after play twenty five hour in just four day with no sign of stop anytime soon I couldn t be happy with this game   the game do throw you in at the deep end though so the official wiki be probably go to be your new good friend   http    stardewvalleywiki com stardew valley wiki   the visual of the game be similar to terraria and starbound but that s where the similarity stop   anyway   it s a great look game if you re a fan of pixel graphic but even if you re not   you shouldn t write the game off   everything in the game be well design and fit in nicely with the style   it s also a very colourful game make all the nice to look at    so   as you d imagine   the main gameplay come from farm   each of the four season   which consist of twenty eight day each   see a wide variety of different crop and flower available for you to grow and you ll be plant most of your crop at the beginning of the season   some crop   like parsnip or melon   can only be harvest once before you ll need to plant they with new seed while other   such as corn and cranberry   will continue to produce fruit vegetable for the rest of the season   once the season end   crop specific to that season will die and you ll have to clear they away before plant new crop   you will want to plant a variety of crop   mainly for the community center bundle   more on that later   but it s worth remember that the more expensive the seed be   the more valuable the end product will be   there be also fertilizer you can use before plant your crop which will increase the chance of high quality crop   you have basic   silver star   more valuable   and gold star crop   considerably more valuable    as well as fertilizer that increase growth speed   it doesn t end with plant they though   you ll need to look after your crop by water they each day   unless it s rain in which case you don t need to   as well as building scarecrow to keep crow away   you can also harvest or make artisan good   such as honey or maple syrup which be do through special machine that you ll need to unlock and then build    unlock come with level up your five skill   every time you increase a skill   skill be increase by simply use the skill so   for example   your fishing skill be increase by fish   you ll unlock new machine to build as well as increase your proficiency in that skill   once you hit level five and level ten   instead of unlock something to build   you choose a profession which will boost a certain area of that skill such as      fast crop growth for farming or     ore per vein for mining    speak of mining   there be other thing to do in stardew   mining   fishing and foraging be the main alternative to farming but there s also social thing to do as well as restore the community center   the first three be pretty self explanatory but I ll briefly talk about fishing   fishing be the main part of the game argue about in the forum   personally I really like the fishing mini game but many don t   it consist of try to keep a green bar behind a move fish icon and for large fish it can be quite challenging   however   as you increase your fishing skill and you yourself get more used to the mini game it do become quite fun and a little less challenging   it s also a great way to earn extra money when your farming chore be complete   the social side of thing mainly consist of do little quest for other character   such as catch a certain fish for gus   the saloon owner   to use in a new recipe   but you can also give gift to other character to make you like they more   give enough gift to one of the ten bachelor bachelorette in the game to get to ten heart will let you propose to and then marry they   open you up to the possibility of have kid in the game   the last thing here be the community center   the community center have long since fall in to disrepair and once the mayor unlock the door for you you ll be able to start build it back up by complete bundle of item   each room have several different bundle for you to complete   complete each bundle will unlock a small reward and complete all the bundle for a give room unlock a big reward   such as fix mine cart which can be use for fast travel from three location   the bundle be mainly for four item though some only require two and other require five    the last big thing to touch on be house upgrade and livestock   there be two house upgrade that you can buy which will make your house big as well as unlock something new to do   the first upgrade be a kitchen which mean you can cook food and the second upgrade add child bed to your room which you ll need if you want kid   to purchase these you ll need a fair amount of gold as well as a specific amount of resource which the carpenter will ask for   you can also pay the carpenter to build you what you ll need for keep livestock   range from chicken in a coop to cow in a barn   keep livestock seem to be a lot more work for a lot less gain than farm crop but you can still get good from the during winter while you can t grow anything during winter   unless you ve repair the greenhouse through the community center    it be also possible to sell the livestock for a profit if you get they up to five heart but I haven t figure out how to do that yet    finally   the save system   the game automatically save when you go to bed at the end of each day and there s no way to manually save   this be another thing a lot of people have complain about   it also happen to be what make the game so damn addictive   I often find myself do a couple of thing in the morning of a day before I turn the game off before realise that I ll have to finish the day to save my progress   since the first thing you ll do each morning be chore you ll find yourself   like I have several time   play the rest of the day just so you don t lose that progress   it can be frustrating if you need to go and don t have time to finish off a day but it s a clever way to keep player play the game     stardew valley offer player an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable experience through its farming simulator style gameplay   though there be more to it than that   whether you re a fan of similar game or you just want to try something new   I can not recommend stardew valley enough      el k

pretty neat game   start play with the idea it would just be a regular   calm farming sim to pass sometime on    after       hour in I can say that it s just that and more   just about anything you want it to be   wanna just play the farming sim   go ahead   wanna fight mob in a never end   randomly generate cave with      number of floor   knock yourself out   wanna start a family   sure thing   wanna get rich and then gamble it all away       well you can   if you want    lot of variety   will most likely keep play the game to completion
don t be fool by the pixel graphic   this be perhaps one of the most addicting game I ve ever play   get it if you be a fan of old school harvest moon game or farming game in general   it bring back the nostalgic feeling when I be hook to hm back to nature on ps   when I be still a kid       
a wonderfully craft game with a lot of heart and addictive gameplay    in stardew valley you ll start with create your own character   choose from different hairstyle   clothe and select if you re more of a dog or cat person   after that   you ll escape your dull city life and move to the farm you inherit from your grandpa   doesn t look like much in the beginning   but that will change over time    you ll probably start off clear out the space around your farm   chop wood   cut grass and mine some stone   then put some seed into the ground   water they and wait for the harvest   to skip that time   you can head to the nearby village and get to know all the different character in town   give they present to increase their friendship and find out more about they through small cutscene which appear after you reach a certain friendship level   there be also a handful of single lady and man which you can marry later on and get child with    if you be not so keen on farm   you can also build barn and coop and buy animal   they will produce good as well   egg   wool   milk etc    fishing be also an option   which require to solve a little mini game   or you could head into the nearby mine to get some coal   gold iron bronze ore and other thing   but beware   the mine house some monster like bat   slime   skeleton and more which will attack you if you re close enough   so don t forget to pack a sword and some food to replenish your health    everything you harvest and mine can normally also be use for artisan good   which will require different equipment you need to craft first   but in exchange will give you good that can be sell for a high profit   or use to craft other thing like food     there be plenty to do in stardew valley   to explore   to craft   people to talk to and a lot to enjoy   of course   at some point   task can get repetitive and even tedious   but you also have a lot of goal to strife towards from upgrade your house   get friendship up with all the people   catch all the legendary fish or furnish your house    it s a beautiful game in which you can sink a lot of hour into   get it as soon as possible   
there be countless way to improve your farm   and the game be fun   whether you be at your maximum to make a profit or not   there s always something to do and the freedom to be creative enough to be fun without be overwhelming   there be fun and interesting side story and quest   as well as a depth of story lore

stardew valley be one of those game that sound incredibly boring but be super enjoyable    you be a farmer and your job be to get your grandfather s old farm up to snuff   to do that   you need load of money   which mean you ll have to do load of farm   you can try out different seed   build helpful tool   cook meal   explore the mine   hang out with the villager   go fishing   or help rebuild the community center   like I say   it doesn t sound very interesting   but once you start play   you ll understand why so many people love this game    note that schedule and time management be an integral part of the game   you can only do so much during any give day and your character have a stamina bar that must never run out   you will be punish for faint or fall asleep outside    it s a bit of a pain at first   but once you know the terrain and develop a routine   it become second nature    highly recommend because there really isn t anything like it on pc

good game to get lose in if you suffer from anxiety depression   give I a reason to wake up some day
this game be a drug
hour of fun   little secret to discover and one of the good game I ve play   the developer have really put his heart and soul into this   can not wait to see more from he
time fly so fast when your have fun
  my and my homie start a farm    after    week we notice the flower dance be come    we ve be give stuff from trash can to the folk   so we be popular    flower dance arrive   we be look sharp    we proceed to get reject by everyone   include the old fisherman      we be about to bail on the dance until    we gaze into each other eye   no word say   but we both know    we dance together until the late nigth and share a bed    no ho mo
tl dr   really fun   definitely a        if you like farm   fighting   and flirt   but aren t too bother with how deep any of these feature go   this game be worth a go     update   the multiplayer   and follow up update make the game even more fun to play   and worth return to   update from a       to a          the farming be the big lure for I   but when you reach mid to late game you will notice that the farm be mostly maintain by itself and you just have to worry about appease the local   if you haven t maxe their affection already    fight monster   if you haven t         bored of it already    or tend to your livestock   if you even have any     make more interesting be that the end game become even more self sufficient when you can start have the farm run itself completely   only need you to plant seed    and the townsfolk do come with their own story and character development so there be always some npc you will end up like   and be nice to they will see you reward as you go along   and I think they basically keep return the favour as time go by   however   once you max out an npc   or marry they    that s where the interest stop   you have your fun   but now they be just do their usual routine and talk to they no long feel all that great since they repeat the same line about how today be   or that you re a good buddy    but   hey   more update be come   and I be certainly excited for they    d especially the long await multiplayer    the game be a pleasant distraction   and it s also mod compatible   so I can definitely recommend this game if you need to kill some time   but don t want to get too enthralled by a story

stardew valley be a tower achievement not in so much that it s a really fun game   spoiler   it be    but that it be make by just one person   and not only it that it be make by one person   but that every single aspect of the game be so expertly craft    the game look and sound beautiful   and from what I understand eric barone craft both the art and the music himself   by itself   that s impressive   then you consider that he program the entire game   balance everything   write the character and dialogue   and fill out this world head to toe with fun   satisfy   and interesting activity   if you have any interest in game as a medium beyond just play and enjoy they   barone s story be mindboggle    there be numerous small example of barone s craft that make themselves know beyond what normal game of this type display   for example   the way people will allow you to pass they with a small shake if you press into they enough   or the sound effect that play when navigate the menu   these might seem trivial   but they re indicative of the quality of experience here   there be so much polish and character to every aspect of this game   and all of it add up to make stardew valley a masterful experience    another example of this depth of quality be the character interaction   I m a sucker for good character writing   in stardew   each character that populate the town be expertly write   with deep character backstorie that surprise I   even the character I initially dislike prove to have more go on underneath the surface   I go into stardew expect a pretty straightforward indie farm management experience and I get so much more    each pursuit be gratify as well   I initially hate fishing   but soon grow to enjoy it once I gain basic acuman   mine diving and battle monster provide a satisfying progression as well   and   of course   farming and build your home and land up from be overgrown to be a palace be not only incredibly satisfying but work exceptionally for what you d expect   I put down fallout    because its settlement system be so awful   stardew valley s   although it admittedly have much less go on   be an absolute dream by comparison   and tie this altogether be the community center system   which require you to plug in specific type of   loot   for various reward   it s what finally get I addict to stardew   stay up way too late try to catch that elusive catfish   or read the wiki while at work so I could find out how to get specific artisan good    if what you ve see of stardew valley have interest you in even the least   you should probably just give it a shot   I think I know what it be   but it prove far deep and more polished than I ever expect a game make by one person could be   and if you like its spiritual ancestor harvest moon   then you owe it to yourself to play this game   it s a phenomenal example of the power of a singular vision when create art   and another example of the flourish indie scene that s develop in gaming over the past decade or so
this game save my life    I be       my ex wife and I have a daughter together   and adopt our son together   they be now both    year old    when we be go through our separation   I find myself lose and miserable   I be self destructive   I get so mad one day from everything spiral out of my control that I punch some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion   that cause I to break my   th metacarpal in my right hand     my work hand     my game hand    the hand that I hold and carry my child to bed with    the hand I desperately need to make sure I could continue to provide    after learn of the severity of my self inflict damage   I be borderline suicidal   keep in mind that just a few month before this   I be the happy man with no history of depression or anxiety   I have never have fit of rage   or be one to break down and cry   but I be in a low spot that just really bury I from be able to see the light on the other side    have nothing well to do   I search for a game I could play   one handed while I recover   I somehow stumble upon this game and read some of the review   I decide that it have to be worth a shot     I must admit   I didn t beat the game   or play nearly as long as some of you   in fact   I may have only play this game a day or two    with that being say   after do so   I have a new find joy and hope for life   I be able to put behind I the pain and suffering that have be cast over I   I be able to experience other people joy and happiness   I be able to see the fruit of my   labor    I relax for        ing minute to this music long enough to realize that I be go to be okay    after come to that realization   I turn the game off   and I go back to work   it hurt my hand like hell but I be motivate   I stop feel so damn sorry for myself   and I become the father I need to be in that moment   not the weak boy I be behave as    today   I be close friend with my kid mother   we don t fight   or argue   or say hurtful thing to each other   we be parent   and friend    I now have    kid   my third child be   wait for it   also    year old   the woman I be with be go through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation   and we just stumble in to each other life unexpectedly   we have be in a relationship for a year now   and be very happy together    moral of the story   you never know what life hold in store for you   and if I would have give up when all the odd be stack against I   I wouldn t be where I be today   this silly little game help I realize that    thank you
a small dip into this game make you aware that this be more than what it say on the tin    almost every aspect of this game seem to have be give serious and careful thought   down from the sound of the environment to the visual and character story   yes they exist here    very well rounded craft   farming and sell system revolve around the season and player level    you gain a significant sense of community if you choose to interact with the villager and help they out   with all those positive say let look at what could possibly be improve    these mostly refer to end game as this game s pace be judge by how you play and therefore you don t miss out on event as they will pop up when you start work towards they    map size   possible the bus service take you to more than just calico desert   farm size   possibly allow the player to expand the farm as thing can get cluttered   the rng achievement   these should not be as grindy as they be   for people who want to have a perfect farm collection friendship point   should be allow to without have to fish for day on end or hoe ing at the artifact worm like a madman until all sanity be lose   and praire king should just be leave alone and treat as a separate game altogether    otherwise there be not much else that can be improve upon   there be bottle neck with resource if play with friend   but I find these be necessary as you should have to work hard to get a big   profitable farm go     an easy         would recommend for single and multiplayer   gg concernedape who single handedly make the game over year    edit after more hour    add load of mod   of which there be plenty   well make one by the community   would highly recommend as it bring load of new hour and even objective in the game   I have ye to try the stardew expand version which look amazing   very easy to mod as well   all you need be vortex   from nexus mod   and just install through the application    very easy to make a backup of your save file and very easy to edit they yourself if there be any bug
it s just a gem   a relax game with a multifaceted developer that put a lot of effort into each aspect of the game   result in great game design and a rewarding sense of progression

I get          apocalyptic vision play this    stardew valley allow the player to enjoy the life of a farmer without the drudgery of actually comitte to all that a life of soil entail   it be the synthesize experience   just at the cost of all the heartfelt extrasensory stuff that would otherwise make say toil worth it   there be no fresh air for you the player   it be imply   the food you grow to enrich the community and pallate be process and cook instantly   but hardly of use to the player the same way as it would own a real farm   jean baudrillard describe in simulacra and simulation         how an emulated experience can and will supersede the reality of what it simulate   if say reality be good enough at fill the same need gap in our heart soul hour   in other word   there be might not be any real loss loose the dirt under the nail authentic experience of farming   if we be provide with a simulation that properly push our button   and we be really into it not for the extra sensory reward of   say   fresh produce in the first place   synthetic experience be by their very nature more pure and efficient   even as they remove and reduce the experience they simulate by remove sensational outlier   be they good or bad   stardew valley be in this way   perhaps well at fulfil the fantasy of farming   than real farming could ever be   all the same however it be only a simulation and poor in last experience   real   farming life would be rife with   with all this   the same question keep roll over in my head   on and on   why be I so satisfied with this    you denominate and play as a person travel to the countryside to enact change in their life   to breathe clear air and to do something meaningful with with themselves   in the game you get your lot in order   begin farm and perhaps some light animal husbandry   while get to know the local and integrate yourself as part of the community   none of this actually put fresh air in the player lung   allow they to befriend new people or even eat fresh produce   the sense of accomplishment for this be leave however   perhaps strong than it would be in real life   as the achievement of week or month be destille into hour of playtime   the simulated experience can take liberty with the less favorable part of the lifestyle   care for animal be reduce to pet and harvesting   cut weed be do in determine swoop   talk to your neighbor in the jrpg fashion where listen to short snippet of their life remove any chance of the small social mishap so common in reality   be that enough   be the context of video game simulation enough to settle for this over the real thing   this be what have I worry   often today we be ask to make concession of quality to manage to eke out enough catharsis to survive week to week   or even   for some people   day to day   much of the way modern life be organize be directly harmful to both our physical and mental health   the enivronment   and long term survivability   if context be all it take to become complacent then there be nothing stop we from create rationalization for similar concession of function or form   part of baudrillard s discussion of simulacra be specifically that a simulation can become reality if it be   good enough   enough   settle for less   if the cut out bit be unwanted   be in fact more   robotic   similarly to the stardew experience   allow the owner to keep the good part of a labour force   while also cut out the extraneous awkward aspect that make for a less effective work environment   a robot do not want need right   currently   and do not complain about or demand well working condition   in such an instance the ratio between human ingenuity   problem solve and flexibility   and effective uncomplaine perpetuity   become purely economic   scale away the human element of a workforce be in fact good economy as it more effectively produce the dopamine of the economy   ie money   the good quality be perhaps not inconsequential   similarly stardew valley be a good game   but again   quality need to be weigh against the ratio that produce the most dopamine   mean that trim quality   real air   real fresh produce   can and will be the most effective alternative when or if the goal be to experience the most painless route to the goal    stardew valley be perhaps well at farming than actual farming from a pure dopamine perspective   just as cocaine be well at have fun than take the time to do enjoyable thing   and robot be well than human at work and make money   and that scare the living       out of I

I have be look forward to this game for about    year because I ve be die for a harvest moon type game on the pc and stardew valley have absolutely meet my expectation   I rarely ever buy a game on full price on steam and this be one of the few I have buy on release    stardew valley be essentially a really addict farm simulator game on build and expand your farm that you inherit from your grandfather   it also offer a very fun and challenging fishing minigame that take a while to get use to   a fun mining and combat system of try to reach all the way to the bottom of the mine for loot and treasure while fight a good variety of monster along the way   the social aspect be also great   you can become friend with the people in the town and may even marry someone and have child    this game will provide hour and hour of fun and will keep you say   just one more day    
one of the great farming simulator rpg game of all time   stardew valley be a must play for people that enjoy relax   management   simulation   grind and relationship building type of game   you can also play co op with your partner or friend and enjoy work on a farm together    pro     good pacing and feeling of steady progression   beautiful music   lot of customization   lovely sound design   lot to do and collect   fun gameplay   good story   don t expect an epic amazing storyline but it s pretty good writing for a video game and have a lot of heart    con     character portrait be sort of ugly thank god some mod can edit they    repetitive gameplay   combat isn t that great   some minor bug    if you like harvest moon   this one hit the right spot   there be nothing miss here   there be more   
so   after     hour of gametime   relationship goal   in game   though   not in real life     very tiring battle   generate income   and plenty of grind   I ve finally beat the game   and not go to lie   I really like the game   and this time   I m go to review this piece of gem    first off         story    character      since this be actually contain spoiler   so     spoiler alert     only click it if you ve beat the game or if you don t care about the spoiler   so   for the story   I m only go to give you the sypnosis of the intro   I can t give you the rest of the story   because     I just don t want to   so   here we go        and that s it for the story I can give you   the game actually have some backstory that be really good   and might suprise you   and   the game s not only have the town s story   you also have a story which involve the company that you just leave   and then   the character   there s ton of they   each of they have some personality   and   each of they have some schedule and thing to do   but sometimes they go into somewhere else   and also   each character have some background and event that s actually great to look at   and can make you either love they even more than ever   make you think twice for trust they   or even fully hate they   which be amazing    and now   the second thing of the game s aspect      not go to lie   I actually don t really pay much attention about the graphic   I actually can just put it into the end   or I can just throw it into the tr shcan   ngl I actually don t know who be danny devito   but I like this word     but   this be review   so   I should talk about it   for the graphic   well   I like it   the dev use the retro graphic   which be look great to I   not that I actually like the retro graphic to begin with     the background and location be look good   and in fact it s good on any season   the character sprite be really great to look at   the monster be amazing   and   the portrait on the other hand      umm     I actually use a mod call   anime portrait   by ohodavi   because I love it so much   despite the fact that I never watch anime   but to be honest   the original portrait look good for I   I actually like it    and now   the most important aspect in the game for I   which be       now   how do I say about this   oh yeah   have you ever play harvest moon   if you do   it s almost similar like it   if you don t   that s okay   I ll tell you   first off   the farming   obviously   you have regular farm   the cave   and greenhouse   the regular farm look very messy at the first time   and you obviously need to clean it before you can use it   and then   if you have clean it   you can use it to plant anything   from potato   pumpkin   to even tree   if you need more of it to make your farm look good    and   you can make your plant grow fast   or well   and don t forget to take care of they from any   intruder    and just like harvest moon   some plant can only plant to a certain season   which mean   you can t just rely on single plant to get rich   second one   the cave   you can use it to harvest some fruit bat   or mushroom   but you need to make money before you can use it   because it s empty for the first time   after that   don t forget to chech it daily   and last one   the greenhouse   like I say before   you need to do some chore to unlock it   and after that   you can use it to plant anything in there just like you do in the regular farm   when I say anything   I mean    even if it s not on the right season   so   if you wanna plant your favourite plant   you can plant it there   as long as you have the corps   that be   the second one be mine   just like harvest moon   you can mine some ore and mineral   you can use they to upgrade your tool   or just donate they to the museum   you need pickaxe to mine   obviously   and then go into the mine   in there   not only there s ore and mineral to mine and take   there be also enemy to stop you   which will talk about it soon   and speak of the mine   there s two of they   the regular and the hard one   in the hard cave   not only there be some high quality ore and mineral in there   but   there be powerful enemy in there as well   you need more powerful gear to get in there   and then   combat   oh boy   the combat   first off   there s some enemy in the game   in the mine especially   some of they be fly   some of they aren t   you fight they with sword   bomb   or even slingshot   and   the more level in the mine you get   the hard the enemy be   sometimes   they drop some stuff that can be use to craft something that can help you to fight the enemy easy   and also   try not to let they get you game end   anyway   this be amazing   I like it   oh wait   you think that s the only thing you do in the game   haha   no   there s other thing you can do   in this game   like talk to other people   play some minigame   fishing   have relationship with people either into different gender   or same gender   get marry   go into the event and carnival   and many more    and then the last aspect of the game be      yeah   the audio be really good   the ambience be amazing   it always make I got relax for listen into it   and the soundtrack be pretty great   especially the winter one   I really like it   the song make I got relax even more   I can t explain it more   I just really like it   you can just experience it yourself    so   in conclusion   I really like the game   it s a great game   it make you remind of the old day play harvest moon   for people who ever play harvest moon    you can either buy it on sale   or buy it immediately   anyway   that s it   hope this review make you wanna buy the game     thumb up for this game   hope this game release in the afterlife as well
introduction   at first glance it might look like a simple   d clone of harvest moon   but the game give more than what meet the eye   as someone who have be immerse with the gameplay for almost a week now   the only thing that I could say be to bid farewell to your personal life and have fun     gameplay   the game start off with you talk to your grandfather and he hand over a letter that will give you the chance to change your lifestyle in the future if you ever so desire   year later on   you be live in the city and work as an employee of a grand corporation name   joja corporation    but feel empty inside   that be then when you remember what your grandfather leave you and take the chance to start a new life with nature      in this game   you play as a village farmer who inherit the land from your grandfather   after the introduction   you will also start with the basic version of tool that you need for grow and maintain your farm   which can be upgrade with the require item and money through the town s blacksmith   and some cash to purchase the thing you need   which be basically money to buy seed     each season will cycle on a     day basis   which also have you limit on the crop that you can sow and harvest   aside when grow they inside the greenhouse    weather also change depend on the prediction from the forecast which will help you on plan the task you need to do as the game progress    aside from the farm   you can also interact with the other villager   npc   by either help they out from a certain request or by give they gift   which will help you in befriend they or even be intimate   only for those who have the   single   word below their icon on your list   if your relationship level be high enough    but not only that   you can also fish   mine ore   find and donate artifact   raise farm animal   turn your crop or good into product   forage fruit and flower   or even explore dangerous cavern and mine and become a true adventurer                      well   I ll just save you the time and get straight to the point   if you ever have that one bit of interest when you see this game             
stardew valley be probably one of my favorite game to sit down and spend    hour completely ignore my responsibility and depression   it s so relaxing and the character be lovable and all have interesting story and personality   stardew valley will continue to be one of the few positive thing in my life and I highly recommend this game to everyone and anyone
   I don t know when it begin   all I know be       hour later   I m finally do with this game   don t play it if you want your life to stay in tact   just don t   it ll suck you in and you win t be able to escape until you ve do all the achievement you want   why   you might even go completely insane and strive to get all of they   your life will be ruin   ruin   you ll neglect love one   your friend   your pet       where will it end   oh   where will it end
because of this game   I own two ps s    ignore my time play   I buy this on ps   first and I ve sink more than      hour into it   no joke   at this point   you don t need my review   if you re think of buy the game   the rest of the review here be strong advocate than mine   but I m give my take on it anyway because this game deserve it    I start play because I be exhaust at work      day in a row   and stress out af   my roommate have start play it and the way he talk about it make I want to pick it up   I like harvest moon   I expect it to be similar   it be   and it isn t    first impression   soundtrack be super chill   it s just very    nice   serene   the most relaxing       I ve ever hear   sometimes   and I m not even kid   I put my headset on and head to the seaside and just pause the game   I nap in rl   the sound of the ocean be just that perfect   same with the rain    mechanic   it be kind of frustrating to hit the wrong grid square   but you learn pretty quickly to turn on the target square   and then you only miss if you get too impatient   I find the control a little more difficult on the computer   but that s only because I ve mostly be a console gamer my whole life   and likely because I haven t quite figure out the good way to configure it for pc   I m have a hard time switch between tool   and it s probably my own fault   but it make it a slow play for I on pc vs   ps     that say   there s great diversity for what you can do   and you can totally do what you enjoy most   farming   mining   fishing   forage   socialize   etc   with a great system of progression that give you in game bonus and unlockable material    story    mind blow   harvest moon have a cheap plot line you didn t even have to pay attention to and one dimensional lifeless love interest who only exist to provide the next generation of banana farmer   stardew valley have amazing depth of character   at first glance   you see a bunch of people you barely know anything about except for the all important first impression   shane s a drunken jerk   sebastian be emo   penny be quiet and bookish   etc   but as you get to know they well and spend more time with they throughout the game   the character reveal bit about their past that be at time too real       important   this game actually allow same sex relationship   which be          awesome   thank you concernedape       I choose sebastian for my main playthrough   none of the other guy appeal to I   though I do consider sam   spoiler ahead    sebastian be stand offish   he s one of the hard to connect with   as he rarely leave his room and spend the majority of his time on the computer   I correctly assume he be a brain   and I correctly choose to try to impress he with cool rock I find in the mine   eventually   he tell I he be a freelancer on his computer   and he be aggravate so many people think he s in his room just play around   even I assume this    his mom be remarried   maru be his half sister   and he be emo because she get more attention than he do   make sense   she have both her parent and she clearly take after her dad   they re both into science    sebastian play music with his buddy sam   but they also play tabletop rpg    what really hit home for I   though   be sebastian s obvious depression   I m married irl   and my husband have pretty bad depression   so watch sebastian struggle with it only make I love he more   some morning   sebastian give I coffee and help around the farm   some morning   he say he s go for a walk   and he doesn t really like to be bother while he s on his walk   he like to have that time to himself   there be day where I really worry about he because he seem so check out    and then there be day where he be so vibrant   I feel well about how thing be go   one morning I wake up and he be like    I change the wallpaper   do you like it          I decorate my house in some nice earthy color with a splash of blue or green here and there   sebastian wallpaper my house with skeleton   but I be so happy he d finally make part of the house his own that I redecorate the whole house to match    the main line of the game be jojamart vs   community   too   and you can complete the game no matter which path you take   which feel really good when the community really come together    suggestion   I m really love the artisan good   refine my farm good to make fancy good   I love my wine   and beer make hobby   my only wish be that there be more to do post game   I have all of this money and nothing to do with it now   if I could even invest it in something   that would be nice   I want to tweak my beer and wine to make fancy beer and wine   I want more diverse thing to plant   where be the carrot    or maybe customize the farm more   my only sorrow be that I feel like I ve accomplish everything now and my only option be to start a new farm   so on ps   I have stop play   I be enjoy my restart on steam   though   relive my joy all over again    and I know they be work on multiplayer and some other new stuff   so I be hopeful that future content will bring we stardew veteran more to do    all in all   this game bring I so much happiness during one of the low point of my life   it be well worth what it cost   and I m excited that I can play it on so many platform   so why do I own two ps s   I hear stardew be release on the switch   so I be an hour into the road trip to go buy a switch because it be out of stock where I live and my husband be buy persona    to play on our   one   ps    on the journey to the switch   I discover it wasn t yet available for switch   but I be not give up my stardew time   persona    or not   so we buy a second ps    and the switch   and persona     and some other thing    lololol     if you don t own this game yet   you need to   I m so invest in the character that I even go back to fan fiction   xd
literally put my heart and soul into this game   if you need something to hyperfixate on while you refuse to medicate your undiagnosed adhd   stardew valley be for you
good farming game I ve ever play   hand down   do you really need to read anymore positive review of this game   we all know it slap
this be by far the good farming game I have ever play   each season one can plant new crop and harvest they throughout every month   which count as a season    whilst complete bundle at the local community centre in order to claim reward and sell home grown produce at shop or the sale bin from the comfort of your own farm   one can construct cabin and farm building   plant and harvest multiple type of plant   and even plant your own orchard   mining and forage   along with craft and fishing   be also important dynamic of the game and boost your experience level in the game   as well as assist in the completion of quest   one can buy animal as cute and practical addition to your farm   if you re keen on cook   there be a conglomeration of recipe for you to try from fish taco to chocolate cake   your culinary skill will be hone   if you be a naturally organised and productive person   there s plenty on offer to suit your game style   boast daily quest   the opportunity to customise your personal routine   and much more   home decor enthusiast may also go crazy with the wallpaper   furniture and decoration if they so desire   of course the game also feature a rich storyline   include the ability to interact with local villager   make friend   and eventually   marry if you wish   the freedom to make your own decision every single day heighten my enjoyment of the game   one of my favourite feature of the game be the flower and scenery and    of course    the animal   my cat mocha be my favourite and I be eagerly work towards purchase a horse which will provide speedy transport      there really aren t many negative to speak of   but if I be to name some   I would think that some of the big one for I be the follow      how difficult it be to reach level     in the mine   and progress from thereon       how difficult it be to catch fish      how slowly a person walk   I definitely recommend this game to farming enthusiast and animal lover alike   as well as anyone who enjoy set goal and create routine and just enjoy the game without a   tycoonist attitude   which be adjacent to a lot of gamer nowadays   I wouldn t recommend it to those of you out there who love   reach the end of the game as quickly as possible    with a cut the time waster attitude   it be a slow moving   relaxed sort of game perfect for those who don t take gaming so seriously   but of course it cater for most gamer   taste    d
a great game for those who love the harvest moon franchise

just start year     and a smidge over     hour play right now   so I think I ve play enough at this point to give an honest opinion   I like simulator game   but harvest moon and animal crossing both tend to lose my interested after a while   they get very grindy to say the least   or just boring   I think stardew combine both very nicely   and add some good old dungeon crawl to boot    I hear rune factory also do this well   but I ve never touch the series so I can t compare      I ll do my good to list the pro and con as I see they    pro      music be very nice and fitting for the season   what add to this too be the music isn t   constantly   drone on   the game break up the music with just moment of silence with ambient sound   this really help break up the monotony and keep you from get sick of the music too quickly   other than that   its just rather nice      time stop while pause   not sure if this be a constant in farming simulator   but still a nice feature so you can leave it up and go afk      exploration and dungeon crawl be reward   not only do enemy drop good resource   but the mine contain a tremendous amount of ore   the further you go down   the more plentiful   not to mention it will record every    floor you go down   so you don t have to restart from the beginning     get a reward every     floor be also a nice incentive       plenty to do   between the farming and dungeon crawl   there s goal to accomplish inside the community center   in the same fashion of the floor of the dungeon   you get reward for complete these task pack   some well than other   but most have be very worth it      level up skill reap nice skill   you can essentially build your farmer to be proficient or do well in certain aspect of the skill   net you a lot more gold depend on how you plan on play   maybe you want forage thing to be worth more   or maybe you want to have a chance of pick up two every so often      get marry be also kinda nice   I mean yeah same old harvest moon have bee do that forever   but its nice your character can marry any other character that be single   just keep shove salad in their face and they ll be all yours    they also help you out every so often        its very open end   no oustanding or time constrain goal you need to accomplish or you fail   which for someone like I who want to just have a nice wind down game   this be great      there s also a butt ton of reference and easter egg   if you like that stuff    I sure do       con     I generally try to take something positive from these though       personally I find the penalty for run out of hp in the mine to be a tad steep   lose about      of my item       g and the memory of the previous     floor   so I have to do they all over again before be able to advance again   overall it wasn t a big deal and I m more careful now   but at the point I be in when it happen it be very detremental      unless you really stay on top opf the rest of your farm   tree and debris be go to multiply big time   the hole western side of my land be just a mess of these full grow tree from out fo nowhere    it feel that way anyway   where d they come from          character option    really just shirt wise   since that s the major thing outside the hair    feel a tad samey and just switch the color most of the time   don t get I wrong there s over      option and I applaud that   just they didn t seem very different from each other      a lot of the bachelor and bachelorette just come off to be     kinda really unappeale   just their attitude and personality be hard to like in most case   this be completely subjective though   but I find myself half the time just go   wow   you be a really intolerable person       this game be go to eat up a lot of your free time   or maybe that s a pro   either way   beware     overall if you re itch to play a really good farming simulator   and have enjoy game such as harvest moon and animal crossing   I d totally recommend give this a go   I d say its worth be price of       even though there be not so great aspect of the game   I think the good part greatly outweigh the bad   you can usually take something positive from the experience   mostly the game be fun   and in the end that s what matter   if you can have fun with it   you re go to enjoy it

stardew valley be an indie attempt at a harvest moon title   and a very good one   the game give you a big assortment of animal   crop and fruit tree   which you ll need to tend to and sell   or use they to create artisan good   eventually   you ll have access to tool that automate your daily watering   feed   shearing   milking   and egg collect   which enable more time to focus on the social aspect of the game   or fishing   or explore the mine   each character can be give up to two gift per week   which increase your friendship level   grant they like the item you hand to they   as your friendship grow   you may be treat to a cutscene when you run into that character next   friend will also give you useful gift and recipe in the mail so try to remember what everyone like and keep they on hand   the mine be a great resource for stone   geode for the museum   and valuable mineral   it s full of monster and you can easily get in over your head if you aren t careful or come unprepared   if you pass out in the mine   the valuable you just find be liable to be steal   or you may be subject to a rescue fee   my advice be to not focus too heavily on farming or make money   diversify your day and work towards complete the achievement in the menu   also   don t neglect the community center   gather or plant everything you need for the current season   there s nothing bad than have to wait a whole year to complete the community center because you forgot to plant it before the season change   and don t feel disheartened if grandpa give you a bad review   keep play past the two year deadline and stop when you feel accomplished   this game be suppose to be for relaxation   right

farm game
have sex with a homeless man
I buy this game with a certain degree of skepticism   hear the hype from my limited circle   althought the hype isn t that high just a tad warm   I approach the game expect some kind of tame nostalgia over a mediocre genre kitsch    I couldn t be more wrong    to begin with   and in all fairness   this game be indeed a genre kitsch   heavily reminisce the old day of harvest moon yet this game do it extraordinarily well   so well that it exceed its kitsch ness aspect deliver a solid and charming experience   this be the case where copy a nostalgic feel didn t resort into nostalgia bait but it   somewhat   surpass what it copy turn itself into something new   harvest moon genre be still a classic for I and stardew valley manage to simulate that classic and turn it into something so well    I buy this game at full price in skepticism   now after all the tine I spend and take a break from play for month I feel like the price do do justice   the overall quality sure doesn t warrant any high budget game but its charm be what make this game worthy of praise   I haven t even mention the fact that concernedape do this on his own    gameplay wise   I love the control   the progression   the learning curve and the reward   it all feel balanced and fair   though after get the gist of it the game turn easy it still reward I   the player   by its sandobx y element   when you re rich and capable then you re privileged to challenge yourself   challenge yourself to tidy up your farm   that s what fantastic about the gaming experience   first you begin with nothing   learn all the way to warrant that privilege   and eventually you become master of everything all that s leave be to challenge yourself   through that process of learn you re give a set of goal and charming character that you re end care so much by the time you ve become that master   in my three playthrough I end up follow the same pattern and I d say that s a rewarding and satisfy experience in itself    though to be fair   I d like to nitpick a bit   and this might be hugely subjective that I find from personal playthrough   event and dialogue branch   I m not talk about the joja community cebter branch but the character branch   this game offer a great setting to roleplay but the lack of recognition to the pc profile kinda disturb the immersion of roleplay for I   to put it frank   play a gay character and a straight character offer little to no difference in dialogue and that s a bit of nitpicking from my side    I m not plan to writw an in depth review   I m just ramble over these idea about stardew valley   I ve be think to write this ever since I get so hooked to the game but always refrain to do so   now I decide to ramble a bit    to fulfill the community badge goal    I feel like I ve lay off a bit of burden   I might want to revisit this comment some day   just like I want to revisit this game and be charm again    also I m aware of the impending multiplayer patch   look forward to it and hope that the patch would bring an entirely new experience of play an already splendid homage of a game
just like life    there s no time to do everything   I usually hate all these pixelate retro style game   I ve play they when I be a kid and I always dream about well graphic   so that s pretty much the reason   but this one be an exception   I fall in love with it from the very beginning   relax gameplay   relax music   you can do whatever you like and there s so many thing to do    gameplay be where the fun be   there be many activity in the game   you can see the field with vegetable   berry   flower or whatever   water it every day and wait until it grow   then harvest they and choose what to do   you can simply sell everything or make pickled vegetable   use it in one of your recipe to make some tasty food and maybe even share it with other   you can have animal and take of they by feed they   like cattle or chicken and make mayonnaise from the egg   get bore from grow plant or collect egg   go cut the tree and collect wood to build a fence so that your chicken wouldn t run around your farm or upgrade your house or go fishing and hope for the treasure   there s also cook and recipe collect   you can cook dish from the resource you grow or collect then consume or sell they   other activity be get social with local   do request for they and improve you friendship   maybe even marry one of they in the end and have a nice family   don t forget to decorate your house   you don t want to bring a girl to your shack like some dirty peasant after all   another activity be fight monster in the dungeon and collect ore and crystal   it will take a while to finish the dungeon but it s a good change from all the farming    time never stop here except for holiday event where you have special task   so you need to plan your daily activity   you can t go everywhere and do everything   you either go all social or go to a dungeon or take care of your plant and animal   there s not enough time for everything   if you push yourself too hard you pass out    graphic   well I still prefer modern graphic but modern graphic doesn t always look well   it can be ugly as        this pixel style look decent enough and I don t think the developer could ve make such game with cool modern graphic with a small budget   so I always say   if you don t have a budget for good look modern graphic   go artistic style then    still I prefer my time at portia look    the game have quite a big modding community so there be some good mod   check out nexus for the mod    I recommend this game for everyone   I think most people should like it more or less
I have be play stardew valley since it be very first release   I could not possibly reccomend a game more honestly

someone once tell I that this be a love letter to harvest moon fan    they be spot on    this be a wonderful game and I strongly recommend it
this game be literally my medicine to keep my sanity intact after play toxic game
I put off buy this game for around a year cause I always think   meh   a game about farm   its gonne be hella repetitive and boring   but I just spend almost    hour in one session upon buy so that be a surprise    it cool cause you have quest cave to explore and kill slime an infinite amount of animal you could buy and sell can have a cat or a dog base on your preference upgrade your item house barn coop    though it take day    highly addictive   and now with multiplayer              cause I be prove wrong and I love this game as of now
I totally recommend this game    before the promise       update   I play for almost     hour with little break   my job allow I to do so   haha    this last version help with a   issue    personally   I don t care too much about this aspect   thus I wouldn t call this a issue   with the replayability   after the    th hour   I feel that there be little to nothing to really do in the game anymore   I reach a point be the only thing at my horizon be to make my farm huge in profit   maybe f ck my marriage by get way too well with the other in town and finish some unfinished quest    this be be the lack of replayability would bleed a little the potential of the game   there be no way to move your building once build in your farm   you would have to   in order to reorganize your farm    for aesthetic or to time optimization     move everything   animal include   maybe sell they   to demolish the building in question   so you could rebuild it with your new and improved farming technique   after the   rd year   though   you would have to use your golden gut to do so    I hadn t courage   haha   it be go to be too complicated   by this time   some player would probably create a new save and start over   I try   but miss my old farm before my   st hour in the new save   with a new character   be complete   I decide to wait for the      update    it be on its way    with the sensation   though   that the game have already live up for it s price   for the concept and idea of the game be beautifully think and execute    if the      update s fate be to never see the light of the day   I would already be satisfied   maybe even dream with a stardew valley      but it come    I get back to the game and I m happy to tell that this free update do much more for the game   the replayability   for the character of the town and for your farm than most of the pay dlcs of most game nowadays do   this update actually make the game look way too much cheap   haha    you can now reorganize easily your farm   do some new quest   expand the farm in new way with new building and interact with some character that previously to this update wasn t possible   now   also   the game have different farm map that totally represent the different way to play and profit in stardew valley   this feature totally valorize the replayability of the game   since select different farm map in different save will surely change completely how you play your farm    at least   I would recommend this game even before the update   I play for almost     hour and be completely satisfied   but with the       this game be a must have    specially if you miss good harvest moon game and have a crush on rpg    do not fear   your money will be valorize with this game    and I don t even talk about the incoming co op mode   haha             expand a little about the incoming co op mode    lappro   this be the result of your request      I be just think that it might be a good idea to wait for more information to come out before it   since I don t know exactly how it will work out   so this part of the review be more of a reflection of what the future could bring   haha    there be already a way to play it co op use mod   but I haven t try it yet   see some gameplay with it and   for I   the bug would much rather damage my hype than satisfy it    make a long story short   the distributor chuckle fish be work on translation as well as the co op mode   while the creator   concerned ape   be fully focus in creative content   he   alone   work on this       update    maybe   take in consideration the work so far invest   be safe to say that with the co op mode will come as well some new content to deepen the multiplayer experience   I say this because   while I would love to play with my bride   I can see the game become too easy as well    since the simple possibility to share the task would nearly double your energy bar   meaning that you would do twice in a day what you normally would be able to    this take in consideration only a    player co op   if it allow more to join     well   the logic be simple do apply here    all this   though   would not   in any way   ruin the experience   explore the dungeon   to gather resource or fight some creature to complete some quest   or expand your farm with more people will surely be entertain    with the       update come something that can be use to create some hostility in your farm   a map and a   spell    I haven t try it yet   but it make enemy creature come to your farm at night   I ll certainly try these new feature with my bride      I will expand my review with these information and more once the devs give we some new update towards the incoming mode               off topic   sorry for any typo   english be not my native language

one of the most detailed and amazing pixelate game I have ever play   not only be this game addicting   but never seem to get boring with all the quest and constant farming   I enjoy have a relationship with my favorite character and then end up getting marry   since I can t seem to do either of those thing in real time I enjoyed do it online through a game    d the only thing I didn t like about the game be that I be terrible at fishing   sob   so I barely get any of that do   might need to work on that   when the multiplayer be finally release it will be the good game on the market and even now it be totally worth every penny I spend for it   thank for put out a fantastic game
if you have play harvest moon game and really love they you probably already know about stardew valley   but if you don t      I strictly recommend you to buy it   this game be make with passion   I be lucky enough to win an early copy   and the game be really smooth   you may encounter one or two bug in the first      hour of gaming   but if you send they to the   sole     developer he will surely address they   he really make this game with all his dedication and love   for about    year   it be a feat acomplishe by few guy today   the game have a charming story and character so far   lot of activity   collectable   you can harvest plenty of crop   have different animal   fish lot of different water creature and the game have the right dificult to accomplish thing   make you happy at every time you be able to upgrade your tool   build a new barn   etc   the game have some combat in it give some flavour of rpg   it will sure make you smile and have good sensation that lot of the game lack today   it be totally worth the price   for the ammount of time of gaming you have   I ve play more than    hour and I barelly scratch the surface of this game be   it be garanteed to have lot of update   cause concernedape love what he do   a strong candidate to good indie game of the year
if you enjoy game such as harvest moon or even rune factory   then you will like this game   I adore both of these game when I be grow up and this   in my opinion   feel like the perfect match to go with their theme   farming   mining   ranching   monster slay    seducing   villager with mainly cheap item   and even a bit of secret to it and it can actually make you obsess over it   my boyfriend even think I be stupid for like it so much but now he be at about     hour or so on his account and be addict to the monster and mining   finish his skill before I    gameplay   pretty smooth and can vary thank to a mechanic of luck   give reason to go mining or even play game at the saloon for a super difficult game bad luck   or even seemingly easy game good luck    the fishing be a little bit touch and go at time but be pretty easy compare to the fishing mechanic of feel the snow   another game I enjoy a bit too much    soundtrack   relax pretty much all the time   set you into a relaxed mood   the sound get eery in the mine   but still can keep you calm than a horror game   the sound for rainy day confuse I at first but now be obvious clue as to the weather of the day   overall   pretty great music as it should be for this style of game but well than I expect for the graphic    story   although it be a big chunk of dialogue and farming   almost literally   for the item involve with the community center   end    there be a lot that I find to be lack luster   it wasn t as long as I think it would be   the time I spend on this game itself   at current be over      hour   wasn t to just get the item for the cc completion and the joja completion   although that badge didn t come through    the after story take a short time at the point of where I be   but also add a tiny bit of extra backstory on a character you encounter    mechanic   there be not only easter egg and exploit in game   but also kind of cheeky mechanic in this game   it can be somewhat hard to understand first off but with the help of the option menu s disable enable feature   I e   zoom   show hit marker   etc    it can turn into a semi easy game with pretty simple mechanic    overall   although I have some hiccup with the game   I enjoy and still enjoy all of it   even the fact of the title screen have too many easter egg to even spoil as they blur together   thank you   dev concernedape and publisher co dev chucklefish for the release of this game   it really bring back some nostalgia    now come the real question   will you   reader   be good or bad   thank you for read and take my review seriously   if you read every aspect   and hopefully you will enjoy it after you buy it
stardew valley be an indie farming simulator game release on pc in february        the game be develop by concernedape   and publish by chucklefish game    stardew valley be heavily influence by the harvest moon series   at the start of the game   you be leave a plot of land by your grandfather   when you arrive at this land   you will find it overrun with weed   tree and rock   your aim be to clear this area and restart a farm that will make you money   there be a heavy focus on character interaction too   allow you to converse with plenty of npc around the town and develop relationship which can sometimes result in marriage   this have benefit to your farm as the npc will also help out around the plot too   as you grow your farm day by day   you will unlock new way to generate money   whether it be from simply grow crop in the field   sell fish   or your livestock   the game also have a quest system which will also generate extra revenue for you as well    the game s day night circle be really a key feature in the game too   you will soon realize that there be just not enough hour in the day to get everything do   not only be you battle against time   but you be also up against an energy meter too   I wasn t that keen on the energy meter because literally everything you do burn the meter down fairly quickly   when you start out the game and be just clear away week   you will perhaps get    minute   worth of clearing do before your character be out of energy and have to go to bed in order to regain it   you can regain your energy in other way but the conventional way be just to head to bed and wait until the next morning   the game s fishing system be also a little cumbersome too   it s a small mini game when you head out to the water to catch some fish   I personally find this a little too unforgiving but some may find the difficulty on the fishing feature to be a nice addition rather than just point and click    normally I be not a fan of this style of graphic   but stardew valley have just the right amount of character to make this work for I   the game s vibrant colour and beautiful sprite just make everything click together   it really do remind you of the harvest moon series of game   but have its own unique charm to go along with it   the sound track for this game be also exquisite too   so much so that you can purchase the sound track individually too   the game s ambiance sound be wonderful too   this be one of the few game where I think not have voice act work in its favour   because if it have be do wrong   it could of spoilt the whole game for I    this isn t a hard game as such   it be just a time management game   and a waiting game for the majority of the time   you can get yourself in a situation where your farm will almost fail like I do   spend all my money on seed   plant they   and then a storm come over night and ruin they all   result in I not have enough money to buy more seed   that be the hard moment I have find in the game   build you up again after a really big knock back   but if you be happy to put the work in   you will succeed with fly colour in this game    I have be play stardew for a little under     hour so far   I have be primarily focus on build up my farm and grow my empire   I have yet to touch many of the quest and npc interaction with plenty of content still to see   I anticipate at least another     hour or so before I grow   no pun intend   of this game   what I be most excited about be the possibility of a four player co op mode be release   this will make the game an absolutely epic experience in my opinion    technically   as expect the game run perfectly fine   with     fps       of the time   the game have full controller support   but I find play with keyboard mouse to be well in this instance   there be a fairly comprehensible menu with lot of option to change should you choose   I will give the devs prop here   they be a very active community member with plenty of hotfixe be release   not to mention the mod scene be increasingly become more and more popular with this game    stardew valley be a game that you will either love or hate   if you go into this game expect plenty of action and fast pace game play   you will be disappoint   if you want a peaceful   slow pace experience   then you will definitely want this game in your library   there be time that I be sometimes just play mindlessly and the thought of   be I actually have fun here    keep pop into my head   and sometimes the answer be no   to which I quit the game   but low and behold      minute later I feel my self compel to load it up again just to farm that one last batch of crop I have grow   it be a very additive game that keep I come back for more and more every time   at the moment I be go to highly recommend stardew valley   if the devs follow through on the multiplayer addition   that will quite possibly tip it towards the must play side of the scale        stay away     not recommend     only recommend when on sale     recommend      this be a must play   if you find this review helpful   please give it a thumb up   if you would also like to follow my review

I be a     yo father   probably one of the old people play this game   I be a single father to my son   who be     now   my son get this game for christmas in       from his uncle   so we instal it on his computer and he start play   by the end of the week he have     hour on this game   this be horrible for I   as it be already hard for I to find way to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch youtube   so I decide to make a steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game   pick my character and world and start play but I be stick on what you where suppose to do   I ask my son for help and he host a game for I to join   I love it as it be the good time I have spend with my son since my wife have die   this game have ever since bring I and my son close again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well   this game remind I that there s fun to be have in everything   and it have bring both I and my son many happy memory    I write this from my son s account because he ask I to
to describe stardew valley as a farming simulator do it a huge disservice   the interaction with other character and the magic that lie beyond the mine make this one of the good game I ve ever play   my only proviso be that it be evily addictive     the very definition of a   just one more turn   game    can t wait for the single player and mp update next year
I have no idea what harvest moon be    too many review say   this be like harvest moon     oh it s so cute like harvest moon   and   it s a wondeful remake of harvest moon    that s not very helpful   I never play harvest moon   I never hear of harvest moon   unti this game come along    I be play computer game when it come out but the sne be never my cup   o tea   if you re like I   this be the review for you    without know what harvest moon be   I m come into stardew valley with a fresh set of eye   and what these eye have beheld be pretty magical   the one word I d use to describe stardew valley be enchant   the game play revolve around build up your farm   fight    mining in the mine   fishing and bribe the townspeople to like you   it frankly doesn t sound like much but it s much more than the sum of its part    first of all   the farming be deep and entertaining   there be many crop to sow   grove to plant   animal   sap and a host of artisan type improvement to your basic ingredient   there s simply so much to do here it s tough to see it all   and if you re creative   you can construct some beautiful farm so they be visually pleasing along with productive   it s not easy though    you need to slowly clear your farm   build up your money for seed and you ll need raw ingredient from elsewhere   mainly mine   to truly become productive and self sustain    other area be simple but rewarding   mining doesn t sound like fun   but each level of the mine bring new challenge and reward   fishing can be challenging and even frustrating but as your character level that skill you ll find you re able to haul in even the most challenging catch   it doesn t seem like the valley be very large but as you complete challenge in the community center new area will open up   each with it s own unique style and bonus   you ll forage through the landscape and acquire more resource that way    the townspeople deserve their own mention   they seem like they re the standard trope    the jock   the vain girl   etc     but as you get to know they you ll find they re unique character and somewhat memorable   the villager have their own schedule and you ll have to work around those schedule to get what you want    as for downside   probably the most annoying thing be this   bribe people to be my friend   aspect   I m not a fan of the limitation and I m not a fan of the message that send   but that s a minor problem with what be just a great   fun   relax and entertaining game   I d recommend this game for people from    to      I m on the old side of that scale    it s simply a wonderful product
I have a rough month with anxiety and playing stardew really helped relax I and get I through the rough patch   it give you something to focus on   a goal to work towards   my only complaint be that the dialogue at the festival don t change from year to year   actually   much of the day to day dialogue repeat itself   there be a lot of lovable character   but even after get their star up   they say the same thing they say to I on week one when I pass they on the street   I d also like to see add item at shop and festival from year to year   but it s a nice game to get lose in   anyway

I definitely recommend this game   the thing that make the game excellent be you can do whatever you want at your own pace   its a very relaxing game in my opinion   but if you want a more combative game you can head into the forest or the mine   another thing I like about the game be you can fit yourself into the town   you can chat and gain relationship point every day and end up settle down and have kid   everybody have there own story with this game you can choose from many character to marry or become friend with you can explore the mystery of the town hall and the mine   or you can have a peaceful life plan out your farm s layout upgrade your house and buy animal to take care of   also   the game be a lot like harvest moon   but at the same time not   I would play this game over harvest moon any day   but it still have the shipping box the forage mechanic and relationship bar   another thing I like be the customization   you can pick from       shirt hair accessory and more you can choose your preference of dog or cat   if you play the game you know why they do that      and more   btw the creator make many update improve the game   also would still recommend after beta release play with friend a lot   my rating

gay farming make I happy
I meet the girl of my dream   I visit she every day and talk about everything I could think of   I shower she with gift   time go on and I continue to do everything I could to make she like I   it be time for the spring dance   this be my chance   I go up to she and ask she if she would dance with I   she politely refuse    I go home and cry and do the same in stardew valley      this game be fantastic and incredibly enjoyable   somehow I have be able to amass     hour in the game already     after    day     during a school week     and there seem to be ton leave to explore and unlock    from mining   to fishing   to farming   and just explore and have fun   I always feel like I have something to do   and with the wide variety of thing to do   even if I get bored of one activity the other activity be so different that it become completely enjoyable again    the gameplay be deep   you feel accomplished when you plant and water crop for the first time   you feel excited when you finally get to harvest the crop you ve water every day   pull up a big fish be equally satisfying and get to the next level in the mine be fantastic    talk to npc isn t particularly exciting as there aren t gobs of dialogue   but there s still a pleasant amount to keep I want to talk   get an npc to like you make I feel happy though   there could be a bit of polish in this way   I ve notice a couple of spelling error in the dialogue and sometimes wish I could know more about a character   but I m still pleased with what there be    I ve never play harvest moon or rune factory   which I ve hear be what this game be inspire from   so I can t say how similar it be to either   but since this be my first time play a game like this   it have be awesome not know what to expect   but if you ve play either game before and like they I would assume this would be a great update version for you    also   this game be and be make by    which be such a pleasant change from what have be                    stardew valley be an amazing game   and go to go on my list as one of my favorite   its intuitive   unique gameplay be fresh to see   I would say that it s probably not for everyone   but I think everyone could enjoy at least a part of it   well worth the         price tag and excited to see what the developer have in store
I write this review for stardew valley feel pretty redundant as the game be already very well known and have overwhelmingly positive review   but this game be genuinely great and worth pick up   both for play solo   but also for play together in any of your preferred co op way   you re       go to get your money s worth with this game   it s a very nice and relax experience    it s such a chill game   yeah   it can be pretty grindy   especially very grindy if you wish to go for full achievement game completion   but you don t have to focus purely on the grind    you can also talk to the villager if that s more your type of thing   you can choose to focus on decorate your farm instead of grind too for example   or collect animal   d   most awesome of it all   this game have be make by just    person   definitely worth give it a try
you re either gay or mentally ill or both

   here I will leave the cat   friend who pass by can pet it and give it a thumb up and awards                l       x                                                          
stardew valley isn t just a game   it s a tranquil retreat from the chaos of everyday life   with its charming pixel art   addictive gameplay   and an abundance of heartwarming activity   this indie gem have capture the heart of million   include mine   as I venture into its enchanting world   I find myself immerse in a delightful experience that go beyond mere gaming   I for one love use a ton of mod to add a new level to the game while play it online with mate    stardew valley s world be brim with secret wait to be uncover   whether it s stumble upon a hidden cave or discover an artifact with a mysterious history   the game reward exploration and curiosity   this sense of discovery foster a sense of wonder   remind we that there s always more to see and learn   even in the most familiar place   stardew valley isn t just a game about farm   it s a journey of self discovery   community building   and find joy in the little thing   its delightful art style   diverse activity   and immersive storytelling come together to create an experience that s both relax and enrich
  player be bored   buy stardew valley   intro start   joja clerk be overwork to death   you be a clerk who quit joja to live in a farm   cue hopeful country music       hour later   player be a hunched eye bag mess in front of the computer   eat habit that would put shane to shame   cute country music imprint into player s wild horseradish fill mind    just one more day till I have enough cash to marry abigail    player realize the game have turn they into a real life joja worker   player quit their basement to live in a farm         would play again
to start off   I be initially hesitant to purchase this game because of my dislike for it s publisher chucklefish   also   I be not a big fan of farming simulation game   despite enjoy harvest moon and other city empire build sim and   x game   most farming sim seem to reach a point of feeling like another job if you want to truly succeed   need to follow a maximized layout for efficiency   that be say   stardew valley truly capture my heart for several reason   it start very much like harvest moon in that you sort of inherit a farmhouse and some land and you have access to a neighboring town with it s citizen to interact with   you do your farming duty as expect and try to make money to build structure common for a farm   upgrade tool   and interact with the surround environment and it s inhabitant within a seemingly short day night cycle   what set it apart from my expectation be how balanced the overall experience feel   there be task you will always want to complete   short and long term goal to strive for   variety of activity to persue each day with little pressure to complete they aside from that which the player put on themselves   there be seasonal and weather specific item and event to find catch interact with   but they aren t vital unless you want they to be   the sprite   color palete   music   ambience and overall charm of the game be just right   you can spend most of your time just farm   and go that maximize layout route for high efficiency if you want   though it isn t important   you can spend more time fishing   which be a fairly enjoyable mini game if you can get the hang of it   you can forage and explore a   dungeon style   mining area with an acceptable combat system   you can get married to any townsperson with the   single   status   male or female   and have a family   when a game like this put multiple suitor to choose from to form a more serious relationship   it need to give each a variety of personality and quirk   there be stereotype   but they have a deep backstory and feel more relatable to a player of any age and not so generalize to make they seem like cookie cut out with expect reaction and desire   there be adult theme   but present in a way that be acceptable and understandable to anyone    overall   it s a very solid game that be more than just a farming family simulator   have excellent music   great time spend for enjoyment per dollar   plenty of goal to persue and achieve without seem over burden or underwhelme   just enough feeling and charm without the need for feel     word review   balanced

stardew valley be a farming rpg    I can honestly say that at the time of this writing there be no other game of this genre that can match it in term of fun quality price    if you be a fan of this genre and like old style pixel graphic you can not go wrong with this game
I ve put     hour into the game and I can already say that I will put another hundred    this game may seem like a farming game   I will not refute   but it be definitely more than that    this be a farming   fishing   forage   gathering   breeding and mining game   I be sure I could put more example but I seem to remember just this portion    you be not just work   in this valley there be several people you would probably care about   and some you can even marry   I remember put a stupid smile just because I make a npc happy   the soundtrack be amazing as well   put you on the mood real quick    while play this game you can relax and just do what you want   or pay attention to time and event   it be all up to you   it offer much freedom like choose farm or your lifestyle    I recommend it to everyone   at least take a shot   the creator be amazing too
   this game be basically harvest moon   but well in every possible way   it be a really amazing game and I m glad I have it   a good friend of mine gift it to I a while ago

wow   what a good game   I ve buy several aaa         game and be very disappointed   this game be     buck and blow they all away    mini game   check   farming   check   quest   check   dungeon stuff   check   mining   check   craft   check   weather   check   rpg element   check   addict    check           why can t a     dollar game do this
wake up   be    energy bar half fill   grind till   be with sporadic pause where you inhale unutterable amount of sashimi   sprint home to get to bed before   be   rinse and repeat   remind you of your reallife   well if you haven t yet internalize the grindset   don t you worry   play stardew valley grant you the rank of grindlord    starfruitillionaire   agedwineillionaire   journeyoftheprairiekingillionaire
if you enjoy any of the harvest moon game   or farming sim in general   then you ll love stardew valley    pro     great atmosphere   amazing soundtrack   interesting and varied npc   each with their own schedule routine around town   different type of refined artisinal good that allow you to customize and specialize your farm   a moderate learning curve that make failure nearly impossible but success both challenging and rewarding   animal be cute      craft and skill system   a slew of objective and unlockable that add a great sense of progression and keep you entertain even after you re financially stable   fishing   mining   forage   and   adventure   can be somewhat profitable and present a good distraction   upgrade and decorate your farm and house   con     a few minor edge case bug   but nothing game break   the game can only be save between day   prevent both save scum and save quit during a day   once you marry someone   your spouse generally lose most of their personality and turn into a domestic robot that abandon their previous routine   definitely a great game in its own right   and the developer be very active on reddit and elsewhere          would desperately eat algae for energy again
stardew valley be a wonderful game fill with character   heart   and there be also farm and mining   there be so much to do in stardew valley   and I appreciate that you can do it all at your own pace   the game can feel a bit daunt at first and you will find yourself play on one screen and have the wiki open on the other screen   there be so much pack into this game   there s farming   sell   mining   fighting   craft   cooking   and build   all of which be do very well aside from the clunky fighting    where this game truly shine be in the people that populate the game and the story that unfold as you get to know each person   be shane the town drunk   or just a young man fight depression and hopelessness   be haley a stuck up princess or will she realize there be a good life in the simple and mundane   will leah do something with her art   will clint overcome his low self esteem and ask the girl he pine after out   be penny destine to live a hard life with pam   her alcoholic mother   why be george such a grump   he will tell you and you will look at he differently afterwards   will the two secret lover ever become public   will lewis put himself first instead of the town   will elliot get the courage to write   will the governor ever like the town soup   will marnie ever be available when you want to buy animal   nope    each character in the game have personality and a story to tell   as through these story your first impression of character may not be the impression you have of they later in the game   shane s struggle hit home for I as do penny s longing for a different life    this game help I get through some dark time in my life and I be grateful I purchase this during the steam summer sale   I be even more thankful that I take the time to play the game and understand it   put in a little effort make the journey a far more enjoyable experience    lastly   the modding community for this game have turn the game into an even well version   there be many mod to choose from and I appreciate all the creator for the work they have put into this wonderful game

sacrifice child
don t buy this game    I know   that s weird to read from a review that recommend the game   hear I out    you re probably like I and have hundred of title in your backlog   game you ve never beat   heck   game you ve probably not even instal yet   if you buy stardew valley   they be go to stay there for a long time    this game be charming in a way that be honestly hard to describe   on the surface   it look like a game that could only be describe as work   start from nothing   you toil away on your newly inherit farm and try to make an honest living   the feeling when you clear your first plot of land and start a tiny farm with    potato that you have to manually water each day when you first get up feel oddly satisfy   you start to get into a routine   each day   you wake up   you pet your cat dog and you dilligently go out to your potato and make sure they get the love and care they need to grow up and become big and strong   eagerly await the pay off of your labor    day go by   you meet the people of the town one by one and learn all of their story and quirk   after a few day   you realize all of these other character have their own life they be go about too   you start to develop relationship with they and they start to feel like a community that be fun to interact with and slowly become a part of   it s another part of each in game day you start to look forward to    but   we haven t forget about our lowly potato plot   the day have finally arrive   you pluck those nine potato out of the ground and proudly walk they into town to sell to the local merchant   he happily buy they from you and you notice that you now have a little more money than you originally start out with   this time you buy    more potato and    melon seed   you run back to your farm   clear another plot of land and plunk your hard earn seed into the ground    this be how the game get you   the slow trickle of progress   the thought of wonder about what wait around each next discovery and the slowly grow farm you personally develop in any way you see fit   if ever there be a game about farming that have the   one more turn   mentality instill   this be it    pretty soon   you notice hour be go by and you ve stop play all your other game here on steam   counter strike   fall out     grand theft auto v   they all fall to the wayside so that you can spend more time on your ever grow farm in stardew valley    this game will leave an indelible mark on you and your gaming time that you will remember long after you achieve and see everything there be to offer inside of it    so   in closing   as I start by say    don t buy this game    unless you want to really have an amazing experience take part in a world that you win t forget any time soon   it s truly a remarkable game that will take up as much of your free time as you will allow and I personally guarantee that you will enjoy every hour of it
initially   I really didn t care about this game when it come out   I pick it up on the small hype it have around it when it first release and dip my toe to see how the water feel   I be dissapointe and could not be bother to stay for long and leave the game sit in my library for a long time   much latter down the line they release a multiplayer update and this be where my opinion of the game change   it be my girlfriend who urge I to play with she and I decide that I should gave the game a second shot and I m glad I do   my initial problem with the game be how slow the gameplay be   I get the concept and what the idea be behind it but man   play alone in stardew vs play with someone else just feel so much more lively   we be put together our farm rather efficently   join event in town   put together the community center and mine away for those rare resource   it be all very fun   challenging and almost addictive honestly   we would lose hour just do what would normally be mundane task   but have fun do it   I find that my hooking niche be collect item for the museum   I always get a little excited when it look like I find a new artifact    stardew valley be it s own entity in a tried genre of game   I ve find new respect for this game and its genre and can now say I understand why people love these type of game so much   though for I   it do take multiplayer to really bring I in   good game   would strongly recommend with friend
it give you the feeling that you like your life and have friend

more than just farm    I ve never play harvest moon or any other of that type of game   so I can t tell you how this one compare    here s a quick breakdown of the type of thing you can do    farm     season   each     day long   crop take different amount of time to harvest   make wine   beer   maple syrup   pine tar   preserve   pickle vegetable   ranch   chicken   cow   sheep   horse   slime   forage   each season have specific item to find in the wild   berry   root   ets   mining   delve deep in the mine to find ore   gem   and monster to fight    fishing and crab pot   difficult to do at first   but lot of different fish to catch depend on location and time of day   craft   level up   get blueprint   make thing like bee house   furnace   tapper   preserve jar   charcoal kiln and more   cooking   upgrade your house to have a kitchen   get recipe   cook all kind of stuff    socialize   meet the villager   give gift to make they like you        candidate for marriage depend on if gay be ok   family   expand your house   get marry   have kid   wal mart   er I mean joja mart   embrace corporate business model or support local small business     price cheap at joja   rebuild the community center   little spirit thing want you to rebuild the abandon community center by bring one of each type of certain thing to form bundle   also it unlock thing later on I think   and you get free goody for do it   but if you side with joja mart they will tear it down to build a warehouse   mini quest   check the posting outside the town store for reqeuest villager have   like fetch I a radish   or kill    slime in the mine   etc   you get gold for these and the villager will like you more     day time limit   though     oh   and you get either a dog or cat   but they don t anything productive   just wander around and sleep    now that you know what you can do   I ll tell you what you have to do   which be nothing   no time limit   no pressure   well   sure you should grow crop in the beginning so you have money   but you don t have to socialize and marry if you don t want to   you don t have to forage or fish or mine   do whatever you want   whenever you want   though you don t get all the blueprint of everything you can bulid until you level up to certain level   it s not like terraria where you can build whatever as long as you have the material   you could have the material but not the blueprint yet so you can t craft it    I think the key addicting thing about this game be the save point   it only save at night while your character sleep   you can t save whenever you want   which be good if a day be go badly   just back out and start that day over   but bad for get sleep in real life    oh   I ll just take a peek outside my house and see how my crop be do    and I end up play another day     and then another      the time of day move quickly   it take a hour just for I to run down to the beach look for stuff that wash up then over to the little plank bridge area for those pink thing and back to town   shop close at    or   pm so it s a race to get where you want and still forage along the way   if you stay up past   be you faint and lose some money or item or something   I try not to have that happen    the artwork be very detailed   check out the inside of some of the house   poster on the kid s wall   different furniture and wallpaper in the living room   tree   plant   flower be beautiful in all season    music be pleasant but do not distract   honestly I don t hear it much of the time because I m concentrate on what I m do    price be right   you get a lot for your money   the replayability be huge   choose this girl to marry this time   choose a different one in another playthrough   or be single   choose to rebuild the community center in one playthrough   go the joja route in another    highly recommend   there s something for everyone in this game   unless you hate   d game to begin with    parental warning   so far there s only be one questionable thing if you want your kid to play   there be a slight reference to someone have an affair with a married person   you re ask to find something and that item be in another person s room   oh gee   how do that get there    so far that s the only thing   other than the gay thing   that parent might be leery of for their young child to play this game         addendum        over      hour into this game now   feel like      I swear this isn t a game at all   it s actually a space time bubble trap build into the game to make time in the real world move fast   so you think you ve only be play for a little while but actually it s be hour   and you realize your throat be parch because you run out of drink and couldn t tear yourself away from the game to get a refill   and also you realize you re about to pee your pant    this game be the first thing I think of when I wake up   before I even get out of bed I m go over a mental checklist of thing to do   even bad   I get confused about what day it be in real life   and even what month   what season   I see thing in real life that remind I of the game   like a patch of tall grass and I m like   oooh   I get to switch to my scythe and cut that stuff down    then a second later    oh   wait   that s in the game   and I m in real life    or on friday I think   I get to visit the travel merchant some time today   and then   oh   wait   that s in the game     bottom line   tl dr version   run   don t walk   run away     as fast as you can before you too get suck in and it s too late   a black hole s get nothing on this game    and now there s more content   will the madness ever end   will I ever see tree and grass and house and farm animal in real life again    oh the humanity
stardew valley   an independently develop title that I ve notice over the past year or so become increasingly more and more popular among my friend   and the gaming community as a whole   from its day in early access as a single player investment   to what be now an enjoyable experience that traverse the dichotomy between that   as well as multiplayer   whatever flavor you prefer    or even if you re ambidexterous in your pallate   so to speak    there be guarantee to be something here for anyone who be in the market for what be   by all intent and purpose   a farm focus life simulator   normally         in the steam marketplace   I be hope to hold out for another sale of         but see as it just wasn t go much low   and I have apparently miss my window   I pick my copy up during the summer sale of       for a very slight discount of          but the upshot of that   it be worth every penny of the investment    story    you play as an unknown entity of your creation   your grandfather be die   and have present to you in his final moment an envelope   later on   drag down by the hardship of life in the city   work in an office for the joja corporation   this game s version of wal mart   essentially    you decide one day to open this envelope   within   you be bequeath a deed to your grandfather s old cottage in the rural community of stardew valley   act from that moment   you leave your old life behind   and move out there to start everything anew   from herein   the plot can go literally wherever you choose   not in the sense that you can kill the mayor   put the townsfolk in a labor camp   and run your own modern day   far cry    esque   jim jones style dictatorship mind you   but a direction that opt for normalcy   a simple member of a grassroots community   cultivate a peaceful   personally successful lifestyle under your own term   grow your farm   raise animal   go fishing   dabble in the supernatural   explore the mine   make friend   get marry   have kid   it s all up to you you decide   and you decide to do it      if you re more accustomed to modern day    d game with top of the line graphic that tell you what to do   how to do it   and where you have to go in order to get it do   you re already in for a sharp   left hand      degree learn curve   stardew valley be absolutely of those thing   and the beauty of it be that it doesn t to be   either   as it s present   stardew valley revive    and modernize    the core sensibility of game such as back in the       s   and in       before it   draw parallel   but at the same time   forage a new path which have prove it s mettle in the modern age to not only work   but also resonate   people get sick of the same thing   day in and day out after awhile   and with the current kickback to retro style gaming in        this could not have come along at a well time   now grant   there be a little bit of a grind to this game   and you can easily wear out its welcome if you re not careful   player choice in dialog   as well    while acceptable    certainly doesn t present itself as often as I would personally love to see it   but for cap it off at even a few hour a day of play   there be certainly enough content within it to stave away any sense of boredom   and it will get no complaint from I   except in one solidary aspect   which be the horrible fishing minigame   I ve be tell that it can be master with some persistence   but where everything else be a peaceful foray into farm fresh living   it can be absolutely jarring   like go on a walk through a nature reserve   and get clock in the back of the head with a   x    long story short   however   if you re get angry at a game like this   you know something s wrong   I have to literally mod out the feature in order to continue progress   which be to say   in no disrespect to those who prefer an exclusively vanilla experience   this be another favorite aspect of this game for I       the sound effect in the game don t require a whole lot of exposition   but they be wonderfully produce   and be absolutely acceptable   with nothing sound out of place whatsoever   I could   however   go on for day about the music   and that   as well   doesn t have any qualm from my end either   the theme of the main menu   the music in the fall and winter season   the dance of the moonlight jelly at the end of summer    there be just so many good song in this game that evoke so many good feeling that you just can t help but like they   no matter who you be or what you re normally into as far as that stuff go   you would have to literally be a sociopath to not enjoy the soundtrack to this game   know all the more that this be the work of only one man    eric of concernedape    only add to how impressive the collection be   especially from the perspective of someone who have also create his own music in the past   which be maybe      th of this level of quality at well   highly recommend      aside from some very miniscule frame drop in obs studio whenever I stream this game on twitch   there s no quandrie   you would literally have to be run a rotten potato for this game to not be well optimize   even my dell inspiron   a laptop which boast an intel pentium dual core processor         ghz and    gb of ram   run the game without any issue whatsoever at its full resolution of      x      just the same as on my desktop   which have a gtx        I       k and     gb of ram in complete contrast   all in all   very much to be expect of a game like this      as of my previous review of    I rate all of my game on the follow scale       out of     that fishing minigame    again    be horrible for I   and it dig enough into my personal experience that give it a perfect    out of    would just be lie to myself   and the overall grind be also something that you ve get to be in the mood for   as previously state   but the former can be correct through the use of mod   or just be really damn good   one of the two    and the latter only become an issue with long hour of gameplay   to be perfectly frank   I imagine multiplayer make it a more streamlined experience   and probably close to a perfect     but I will have to revisit this one day after I get the opportunity to try it out   as of            however   speak solely in term of the single player experience   this be my final score   and you would be completely remiss to not buy this game right now   although   a decent discount never hurt anything either   it s all up to you
I have devote my entire life to this game and will continue to do so

I wasn t interest in this game as I think it would be just a farming game   but after play I find the good rpg game I ve ever play       other than skyrim obviously    rae       
stardew valley be a farming simulator   that sort of sum it up and sort of doesn t even scratch the surface    the game have cute   charming visual   relax music and nice sound design   due to the pixel graphic   some animation   especially interaction with npc   can look a bit off   but that s not a massive issue   character customization be surprisingly extensive with a choice between male or female   various hairstyle   a bunch of shirt   and slider to adjust hair   eye   and pant colour    after create your character you start off on a run down farm that your dead grandfather leave you   you clean it up   buy seed   plant crop   all to make money to improve the farm   aside from farming   there s fishing   mining and combat   you can interact with the town npc   eventually get married and have kid   which be entirely useless and stop age after reach the toddler stage   so no free labour    you have five different skill as well which improve when do the related task   basically   it a farming sim   and you can just ignore everything around that   but there s a lot more to do than I first expect    the game have a co op mode add a while after release   it work well enough and make the game a lot more enjoyable    here s the thing   when I first play stardew valley   I think it be boring and didn t bother much until the co op come out   after play a bit with friend   I go back to my single player farm and      just couldn t stop for a long while   it do what it do pretty well   and it s very relaxing   it s also quite satisfy   the little sound it make when you water your crop or harvest they   see your money go up every day   watch your farm develop and your animal grow up   it somehow manage to avoid be too boring   even when you do mostly the same thing every day   there be still a sense of progression   and you can choose between different   albeit limited   activity whenever you get tired of what you be do before    what s honestly still tedious more than anything be the relationship system   whenever you give one of the townsfolk a gift   you gain point   because we all know the good friendship be a result of throw mayonnaise at someone on a daily basis    if you just talk to they every day   you get a much small amount   if you ignore they   however   you will point   before advance relationship   talk to the npc be pretty boring as they mostly say the same line over and over   now these townspeople don t just sit and wait for you   they wander around in town and the surround area   which make it more irritate to try and find they because either you memorize their schedule or look they up on the wiki every time   if you don t use a mod that show they on the map   you ll probably get frustrate   on the bright side   interaction at high friendship   level   be well think out and quite adorable in some case   even with non romance npc    there be a few mod that aren t cheat   but make some aspect of the game a lot less tedious     I suppose I recommend the game   but you might want to stay away if you have an addictive personality or get annoy when your friend dig up the entire farm for no reason
this game be one of the good I ve play   I can go back to it over and over and discover new thing each time   especially with the devs wonderful update    I still haven t         all of the achievement or do everything there be to do   and that s fine because its so much fun to take it at your own pace   and play as you wish   really recommend this to anyone

first off   I be a primarily first person shooter kind of player   however this sweet little game be my anti depressant for when my bloodpressure be high than snoopdog on the    th of april    I buy this game a few day after christmas and within a week I have already achieve     hour   it be a little repetitive but it have very rewarding outcome if you put the time in   it be similar to another favourite of mine terraria    the date aspect be fun and amusing as there be lot of funny   individual cut scene for each bachelor ette    each season be a new wave of opportunity   spring   summer   fall   autumn    and winter   the gameplay be charming and enticing and have a goal to complete the deserted and decrepid community centre   but also to complete your character as a master of many proffession   the sprite be simple and have a more detailed portrait when speak to   they be realistic and memerable    a great game to play with your friend   steal furniture and family member   or fight over potential mate     I notice I ve write a disitation worthy of oxford here but it really be a good game with a developer who deserve a reward for complete a game like this all on his own    p s   it s totally worth      for almost endless gameplay      a loyal farmer   fisher   forager   fighter   and miner
this be a very fun   relax game   when I play a game I always hope to take something away from it   sometimes its just a good time or a fond memory   other time its a life lesson   this game be the last one   sometimes when I play game I have the habit of rush through they and complete they in one or two sitting   this be a game where you simply can t do that   you must be patient   you must plan ahead   you must control your impulse and delay gratification   sure you can sell your crop immediately   but if you choose to wait several day you will profit much more   oh you want pomegranate   well you need to wait a month for they to grow   and even several year for they to mature   this game be full of plan ahead like that   but in do so it encourage you to make the most out of your day and enjoy the journey along the way   that be what I take away from stardew valley
                get it buy and play it    it take I so long to play this game   so many people recommend it and I keep put it off and off   mostly because of graphic among other thing   I play all harvest moon sos games and those type of game in recent year be get really stale with the same tired formula   but eventually I get stardew valley on switch so I could play it on the go like a ds   and my god   I wish I d of pick it up back then    I ve sink hour and hour into this game but one of the good plus be that I connect with my friend family play it co op   I love the gameplay   it s suit to any playstyle   you wanna just play a date sim   it s that   farm sim   go raise some livestock or grow crop and tree   just like design stuff   you ve get numerous farm layout to choose from and go ham   maybe you like combat   or just plod about adventure   there s always something new in this game and be addict well and truly   and I be in the minority that absolutely love the fishing game    then   I buy it on steam and be introduce the modded community and fall in love with the game again   it open up the game completely and there be so many mod that turn the game into something completely new   or if you re like I and love the core game   just add stuff into it that s just for aesthetic or add new place people   similar to how you would add dlc to a game   my favourite and       must have be   stardew valley expand    ridgeside village   hell there s even magic now so you can be your own wizard     what I will say be that smapi   the modding device be pretty complicated to put in   but the mod themselves be really simple once you get past initial setup    I do appreciate that I play it vanilla first and I would recommend anyone do that first because like a good book movie you can t experience twice   this you actually can and it s worth it
it s a fantastic game that you can easily get lose in   especially if you ve play any other farming simulator game   like harvest moon or rune factory

stardew valley be proof a game doesn t require insane graphic to be incredibly enjoyable and addictive   it just need good mechanic   it be a breath of fresh air after year play harvest moon farm sim which   though fun   all have the same issue   somewhat boring archtype character and only heterosexual marriage option   the villager in stardew seem like real people you would find in a small rural town   there be drunk   there be homeless people   there be people fight depression   it tackle the issue of large corporate entity drive out small town business and give you the option to either help or hinder this effort   it do all this while still maintain a wholesome   bright   and non stressful atmosphere   there be challenge element like fight monster in the mine and master the fishing mini game   they give you solid goal to work towards so that despite the repetitive element of the game   you always have something to plan out   overall just a really   really solid farming life sim

   I be at a friend s birthday party   listen to argument about politic and history     liter of vodka behind we and I think to myself in the middle of the party   damn   I would play stardew valley now
I give my axe to the blacksmith to have it improve   he would return it in a few day when it be do   when I get home I want to build a fence for my chicken   duck and rabbit   say and do   I notice I have forget to insert a gate   okay   I think   let I take out one section of the fence to make place for said gate   ala   my axe be still at the blacksmith s   I could not insert a gate   be stick behind my fence and die of starvation   in other word   I have to reload            would showcase my idiocy again
I give everyone in town a fish as a present    I spend the rest of the day dig they out of their trashcan    the homeless guy keep his fish because he doesn t have a trashcan    then I realize I be compete with he in dig thing out of the trash    I think I be bad at this game
virtual chore be fun   tl dr   so this be my first review that I m totally not do for community badge reason of anything since high school   so bear with I    the story be your farmer grandpa die   give you the deed to his farm   and tell you to wait until the monotony of life be too much before reveal you have a farm   I d rather have all the waste cubicle year back   but whatever method you think be good gramp   you arrive to find your farm be all weed and there s no clean all button   not to mention there be a lot of people you don t know and what they want from you be also unclear   which bring I to my first complaint       you could chalk this up to   learn by do   but there be some thing that you want to know beforehand   I wish I d know that put coop and barn can be fairly permanent when start   it s a costly lesson when you find out you can t move the barn somewhere more efficient or that your livestock prefer to eat grass which be hard to do when you place it right next to your crop row   you also make permanent decision early in the game without know the full weight of what you re do   the cave   your choose level improvement   etc   second time around   thing be go to go well   but my first run hit a point where I regret half the choice I make   but there wasn t much to do about it   not to mention   how many time I waste valuable good on people think they d appreciate they   which bring I to my second complaint      what do that mean though   mister conflict statement    let I go get my pen and paper and I ll explain   first   you need pen and paper   or the wiki   I m guilty   to remember what people like and luck   or the wiki   I m guilty   to figure out what they love   sure you get little hint here and there   but when you re limited to two dialogue line per day   per person   it can be daunt to find useful information for everyone in a timely manner   so your alternative be to just give they stuff and hope they like it   but it s roulette   bar a few late game item   everyone s taste be wildly different   I think people would like thing that I pour blood   sweat   and tear into to get and they call it garbage   my gold star pomegranete be amazing   not   eh    that void essence you re hold require I risk my life to get and you could never hope to get any yourself   so don t call it disgusting   valuable item aren t necessarily valuable to much of anyone except yourself   and it d be nice to have each person s like love hate document in game somehow   I doubt it d be hard to make something visually pleasing and people would be less likely to spoil the list online     I love wake up and find all my beautiful crop grow and ready for pick   of they ready for pick   water be automate by sprinkler which be a blessing   but you can easily spend your entire day seeding or harvesting   I know I can decide to harvest or seed to do other thing   but when you have a large enough operation   it feel like they control your action more than you do   you want to go work on that dungeon   but you also want to horde money like a dragon and want that deluxe barn because sheep be awesome   I know it defeat the purpose of virtual chore to have a way to shortuct they   but it d still be satisfying to have farmhand   those joja mart employee would do well with some sun anyway   to pick the stuff through the day or even a tractor to do mass seeding   it s slow go on your own with that giant plot of land   minor complaint   but that s why this game be still highly recommend by I   that remind I   I should mention why I love this game     this be awesome   I get to design a house and create a plant base empire   I get to find some hot girl and marry her      penny    but if I be incline   I could choose a guy   a very progressive move that s luckily become more common in game   you can even make a family   there s also a nice variety of extracurricular such as fishing   dungeon crawl   gambling   cooking and some interesting backstory to find out for everyone   there s some pretty funny drama hide in stardew valley     with game like stardew valley   a common pitfall be lose steam and get bore with have to make your own goal   you build your own pyramid and then you feel the tedium set in   stardew valley however   cleverly suck you in with its community center   a decrepit buildilng inhabit by magic jelly monster that help you fix it up by turn in good you acquire throughout specific mean   complete bundle minor task lead to major reward such as the beloved greenhouse   a building that allow you to grow any crop   regardless of season   I m one bundle away from finish the game   so I can t tell you what happen when everything be do   but the mystery will keep you go     you will never feel like anything you do in stardew valley feel sloppy   combat be retro   there s a block button   but you can usually dodge most monster with a little bit of weave   it could be argue it s too simplistic   but I prefer the legend of zelda feel   follow suit   fishing be easy to pick up   hard to master   farming be pretty straightforward with tool that be upgradable   all in all   the result be soothe mix with bit of flare   that be say   don t die in the dungeon   it be awful and terrible and I can not agree with the punishment the developer decide for it   see for yourself   if you dare     if I wasn t such a productive farmer   I d get space out and enjoy the music   I m not such a good farmer that I be able to ignore the pitter patter of the rain on my humble home s roof   the music be subtly charming while also engross and addictive   I find myself in the town s saloon   late at night   flip through the jukebox   find the song serve as my current earwig   they truly compliment the    bit style of the game too   the pixel character be also give detail with their dialogue portait   make for character that feel more rounded   bad pun fully intend    if you don t like the character portrait though   you can change it because       it s surprising for a game like this to be moddable   but it be   I haven t delve deep into this   but judge from the available mod here on steam   stardew valley be a canvas open to the creative interpretation of anyone with an idea   I m seriously contemplate download the anime penny of my dream     there s much and more leave out of this review   but if you take anything away from this   please let it be this   your grandpa s wish be personify when you play the game   after so many overstimulate title full of action   stress   and competition   it s nice to settle down and get away from it all in stardew valley
  stardew valley   be a very very nice   relax and fun game   it give to player interesting gameplay   include a lot of different thing to do   from complete task to just freely explore the world   from farming to fight with monster in cave   there be always something to do actively in this game     or just listen of pleasant music     the variety of location and the change of season look great   each npc have its own unique character   their development be very interesting to watch   and of course    one of the good part    cute pixel graphic     all of this you can enjoy with your three friend in co op mode   I highly recommend it to everyone    
probably the good farming game on steam   I be a harvest moon player for the last decade and since that I hadn t really think about play another farming game   till I see this   I have to say that I really do not expect to be so captivate   stardew valley be a game without time limit   leaderboard or any sort of competitiveness associate to it   for I that s what make it so awesome   you take your time to do whatever you want and if you miss anything there s always another chance   this game have plenty of thing to do and activity to accomplish   you can pursue what you want in many way   there s no   right way   of play it   in stardew valley I feel like I have a purpose   the sense of accomplishment and progress after finish what you ve plan be great   the character you get to interact in the city have compelling and somewhat   realistic   story behind they   do not get fool by this game s colorful look   some storyline be depressing and not everything be perfect in this city as you ll learn the relationship system work and there s a vast amount of good you can produce in your farm   overall this be one of the game where I have the most fun in the last decade

this game make I realize I m not straight
can t wait for the      update to make every posible bad decision and make everyone hate I again
let I live out my dream of be a farmer and have my husband come home late for dinner
who in the world want to spend their free time farming   who in their right mind want to till soil   plant crop   milk cow   and do all those other menial task that sustain life on the farm   well   ton of people if the success of the harvest moon series mean anything   and it do   because stardew valley come along in its wake to build on everything that make farming game fun   that s not hyperbole either   unless you ve somehow find a game more invite   more vibrant   and more engrossing than this one    your country boy grandpa s kick the bucket and leave the family farm all to you   and you re way too much of a hipster to miss the chance to get back to nature   you ditch your dead end office job and arrive at the humble tract of land outside sleepy pelican town   only to find it in absolute disarray   that s fine   though   because you ve get the tool and the talent to clear the land   grow some crop   raise some livestock   and turn the place into the pastoral dreamland you ve always want   and the citizenry will be more than happy to help   whether it be raise barn   teach you to fish   send you into deadly dungeon   or teach you the dark secret of the universe    now would be a good time to mention that stardew valley be all over the place   but in the good way possible   you re not just get a farming game here   though that be the core of the experience   there be strange thing afoot in the quaint countryside   thing you ll catch wind of in your first few day on the farm   what be that weird tower in the wood   why be that cave to the north block off   do I hear something whoosh past the house last night   while plenty of the game be ground in pick bean and milk cow   there s plenty more hide behind cryptic riddle   lock door   and ravenous monster   and that s to say nothing of the many   many side activity that fall somewhere in between    actually we re go to talk about those activity now   because they re probably what keep I hopelessly hook for      hour   your farming option themselves be robust   with dozen of crop to grow   nearly a dozen animal to tend   orchard   greenhouse   and even a slime ranch possibly inspire by   well   you know   but you can also take your produce and cook it into nearly a hundred dish   too   or you can head out fish to find the many kind of creature lurk in the rural water   you can drop crab pot   mine up rare gem   uncover artifact for the museum   and eventually take trip to whole other region   even combat be flesh out with a fair spread of weapon and two deep dungeon of randomly generate floor    the vast amount of content available could easily distract from any sort of plot   but stardew still manage to keep you focus on a few task   the main concern of the village be the dire state of their old community center   and the soulless capitalist of jojamart have their eye on demolish the place for their new warehouse   you can choose either side to boost   with collection quest for the town or funding for joja   and your decision do indeed change the landscape of the place   villager can be befriend and woo   an involved process that require stuff they full of gift and remember their birthday   but it also reward you with little scene that flesh out their personality and give the town more texture    it s easy to get lose in all the thing you can see and do in stardew valley   and luckily it s design in a way that you ll never run out of those thing   either   even if you get a fully function farm and load of money come in   there be hundred of customization option for your land   your house   yourself   and even your horse   there s a huge building component to the game that you don t really have to push   but you can also spend dozen of hour just craft your perfect homestead   honestly that might have be the part that eventually burn I out on it   because by the middle of year    I have see and do so much that I start to focus on perfect my farm to the detriment of my fun   the main appeal for I be collect and fishing   and once those have mostly run their course I be have trouble get deep into the other part of the game   that variety can cut both way after all   if you really   really love a specific part of the game but not the whole package    but honestly this isn t a huge concern   because stardew valley be first and foremost a game that want you to have fun   it want you to do whatever you want   with bright   happy pixel graphic and peppy music and surround by all your friend and pet   there s an element of time pressure to the calendar and your hard bedtime in the middle of the night   but the game really do give you as much time as you need to do what you like   you can farm   fight   fish   flirt   or find your own way somewhere in its magical world   I haven t even try the multiplayer aspect   but I can only imagine that enhance the core brilliance tenfold with real   live friend   and that s what this game have in spade   the brilliance to give you all the tool to make your own fun   and all the chance and encouragement you need to do it      do you enjoy this review   I certainly hope so   and I certainly hope you ll check out more of they at or on my

just start play this game   but its a whole lot of fun   and a steal         on the summer sale   a definite must buy
you can be gay   epic
this game be an absolute masterpiece   its music be calm   and the game itself be calm   the choice you can make and friendship aspect be well make   though married life could be well   concernedape be currently develop well married life    the game be very addict   so be careful if you have a tight schedule   this game be just awesome   and keep be make well          minecraft   edit I be ready to review the game s new update   first of all   I love fish pond   they be really nice   one thing I don t like about they though     the lava eel pond require two megabomb at one point   and it s easy to accidentally place they and blow up stuff on your farm   second of all   married life   they honestly didn t add much tbh   I like the new event and all   it just feel like it still could ve be a little well   the other stuff they add be all great addition   I like they all   my new rating for the game would be         minecraft
when I be a young girl     I be look for a lot of game similar to casual farm or something similar to minecraft   I remember find the official site of this game and I like it   but then I do not have the money for a license game   but I also do not download the pirate version   but I really want a pixel game instead of a co op terraria or minecraft   and now   many year after that memory   I play it and it s wonderful   now I be try to make friend with my mom through this game   we will play together   of course she would like a mobile co op   but it be not there   my mom do not even like play game plus she s      y o   maybe I will change this game to a diff lang and help she learn english as well    the game be wonderful   worth the money
a cute   highly addictive game   ideal for time when you want to put your worry behind and relax   there s a lot of activity to do   location to explore   and character to interact with   so you win t have a chance to start get bored until you complete everything
what can I say   I think it be a boring game about farming and gift thing to people   what nobody tell I it be actually a time management business simulation with dungeon delving and monster slaying   and by the end of year two I actually find the time for the gift giving and make friend portion of the game    bad of all     it even make I want to do it with all its quest   I really like the game and it be so not what I expect it to be   I expect harvest moon and not a more involved version of recettear   
I and the boy   we like to fish
well than   insert a certain block game
I spend my wedding night break rock in the desert in search of the last piece of a quest to get a legendary sword make out of space   she ll understand when she see how cool the sword be        
in a year   I learn    apparently you can find treasure chest with awesome sword in mountain lake   buy joja mart membership can make you feel like a d      abigail enjoy eat quartz   haley need seaweed for   classified   reason   you probably shouldn t put daffodil in soup   people automatically lose      iq point when they enter a maze   ok   now for the real review      consider I ve already put a few dozen hour into this game over the course of mere day   I think this would be the good game to write up my first review for   I wasn t expect much when I buy this game on sale due to my natural american impulse   I d hear the hype   of course   but I didn t think a farming game would be so interesting   to respond to past I   I be wrong as f      so if you re on the fence about buy this game   buy it   it will be so worth your while that you ll play it instead of do the other thing that be worth your while   this one developer game feature    charming pixel graphic   bundle and other collection that ll keep you explore every aspect of the game   mining   fishing and forage to keep you busy so you don t have to literally watch grass grow    help want   job that can earn you a quick buck and build relationship   the ability to marry by give someone the same thing twice a week   constant building and house expansion to unlock cooking   baby and goat   diverse and well explain npc personality   consider you learn about they within a couple of dialogue and a few cutscene    a logical time system   allow you to accomplish a logical amount of thing in one day         heart with sebastian husbando        rating
       my favourite game   I have almost      hour of game play and I can see myself play for another      hour   I really appreciate that they add more free content so that even if you ve play the game multiple time   you still have new thing to do
farmer
this game surprise you   what seem like a pixel farming game   turn out to have quite a bit of depth and variety   which can be play in a number of different way   you have farm   village social life   fishing   adventure   basically dungeon delve in the mine    and more    that s just what I ve discover so far in a few hour    and you can play they in any combination   focus on what you like   ignore what you don t enjoy   I m just getting start   but I m enjoy it so far   it s also well with friend
if haley have a million fan   I be one of they   if haley have ten fan   I be one of they   if haley have only a single fan   then that be I   if haley have no fan   then I be no long of this earth   if the world be against haley   then I be against the world
I honestly think I wouldn t like this game because I never like other game like it       hour later and I can t stop play this game    the soundtrack be unreal too   one of the good in recent memory   also frig off shane   guy pretend he doesn t know you after you buy he like     beer
you ll never know how addictive planting seed and pick mineral can be until you play this game   that game be everything harvest moon should have be   plus some    fair warning   you might start to suffer from the   just one more day before I exit and go to bed   syndrome    edit        now even well with friend
wish I could kill people and cook meth in this game
  be mexican dude   marry penny   a white woman   get black son   glare at demetrius   the only black man in the community         would be cheat on again
must not sleep   must keep farm
log almost      hrs now and this game be amazing for just relax and take away stress   highly recommend for anyone who find themselves in a position of stress and want to unwind
warning    buy only if you re ready for an addict   wholesome game that will probably take over your life         recommend to everyone
escapism at it s fine
I be stress   tired   nervous and pretty much burn out    and I decide to play this game   and I feel peace     just like the good old day when I use to live in a farm by the countryside    I don t have time to play game anymore thank to my job   but I just schedule an hour a day to play this game   one hour of peace and hapiness in this sea of stress and work
have this game sit in my steam library for god know how long   I regret not play it soon its like crack   once you know what you re do you will not put it down   the music in the game be incredible and for a project make by a single yes a single developer you will be really shock by how much there be to do in this game    concerned ape I want to say sorry for not play this soon its an incredibly well make game and I hope in the future you charge people for extra content as you have earn the right too   yes folk he release completely free update in a game where s there s enough content for around     hour gameplay i d guess but that turn to      s if you want to take your time and build and try out everything and not rush   my partner get I play this because of her nintendo switch which lead to I buy    more copy for the ipad so my daughter could play   give the game a try and it might just surprise you   a game make with a lot of love and a friendly community what more could you ask for
   I ve have this on my wishlist for awhile   and I finally receive it tonight   after play for hour   I can tell you I be super impressed   it remind I alot of terraria   but without the mess of enemy roam around   it be very relaxing and a nice change of pace from other game I would normally play        out of    acorn    update            after play this game for day straight    via co op with my friend   I have nothing but love for the developer that make this possible   I ve have soo much fun playing and can t wait to discover more inside     thank you      out of    acorn
chill   plant some crop in game   smoke some crop in real life   chill some more   fade out while listen to the soundtrack and fall asleep in front of your computer cause it s goddang   be and you didn t even notice and you need to get up for that test in    hour jesus christ
it fun
farm
tldr   highly recommend just for the multiplayer aspect pro   fun   nice art   sense of satisfaction and a hella lot of depth and thing to do in the game con   so far not much   thing be nicely balanced and bug be be iron out so all s good    when I be young I play the hell out of harvest moon   and I remember many many secret late night with a gameboy advance in bed   fast forward to a few month ago and I ve read so much about this game   about how it be all create by one man   see how the art have progress and even give it a shot for awhile    but the feeling that this be more work than play be something that make it seem less fun    so I put it aside   but then multiplayer come out   and since then   I ve never really look back    in some sense it be still work   but when you re play with another person   negotiate what cash should be spend on   who get to design the farm   and split up job   I think thing have become so much more enjoyable   and thing feel like an actual achievement that you can celebrate with another person    it s be hella fun   and I would recommend it to anyone   
amazingly fun game with incredibly awesome music that doesn t play often enough   coughdevscough   and cute pixel graphic    have you play harvest moon but wish it be do well   tired of not own a console for rune factory   well now the pc have it s own farming darlin and honestly it feel like we get the good deal out of the three series   you ll be do your self a big diservice if you purchase another farming game instead of this one     pro   cute pixel graphic where almost everything have a unique sprite   excellent music   dog   wizard   garbage   racoon    deep dungeon to explore when you re tired of shovel poop     con   music end around    be then you get none till the next day most time   no co op yet and who know if there will be anymore   map be confuse for a while   doesn t seem to always have your character in the exact location   controller support be weird in window mode   my mouse cursor be possese

I first pirate it and then feel really bad so I buy it
my favourite fishing simulator
there s only one word that truly describe this game      addict      I m not into harvest moon   I d put an hour into it and then stop   this game though    wow   a friend gift it to I and just go hog wild bonker on it     now I m just find myself try to find other s just like it    be pretty awesome if they would make a   nd stardew valley
   life lesson this game teach I     quality relationship be determine by the material possession you give to other people     run doesn t drain your energy   but water crop do significantly     dog and cat be completely useless     grass take much long to fully grow than tree    I rate      
in stardew valley   you can fulfill all your wild fantasy in a candy color marginally accurate likeness of the great american northwest   such as own property without rent   grow enough food to live on   and have people outside of your family who love you   I ve spend over       hour on this game   send help
it make I yeehaw
leah supremacy
this be one of those game that you will and always will come back to just to relax or to sink several hour a day into    consider I play a lot of game that involve either horror or shooter element   it s nice to just play what s basically a farming sim with rpg element to wind down   the game be definitely worth pick up regardless if it s on sale or not   with how many hour of rng   different choice   how you do thing   there s always something to do when play stardew valley    seriously   don t sleep on this game if you think it look boring   buy it   play for an hour and a half   if you don t like it   refund it   otherwise   have fun
this review be painful to write   I love harvest moon so much   right up until yesterday when I reach a lot of sad realization    hm   you be so cute and accessible   your value and atmosphere inform some of my most deeply hold ideal   and then      I start get too used to you   your trope   setting and character remain constant   and while I will always have fond memory of the time we have together and your comfortable familiarity   I have change and you have not    hm   you be a pioneer but your soil be no long as fertile as it be   I need to grow   I must move on to a land where it be understand that tradition be keep alive by change   where I can test the thing you teach I and experience whole new challange   as well   fear not   you be not lose to novelty   stardew valley be your child and you set a wonderful example for its generation   you have keep something important alive and pass it on    thank you   harvest moon   for all you have do   thank you   and goodbye
simply amazing   calm and relax   great soundtrack for each season   right on point    nature s crescendo   and   the wind can be still   be so beautiful   so subtle    gameplay that I be expect yet I find it well than I anticipate after around the     hour mark   blast hour upon hour this last week   simply addict     oh now I need to get this and deliver that   maybe build this and buy some animal for get that item to craft    oh wait a new npc quest   mine and so on        I will post a final   video tour around my whole farm soon whenever I complete the game   cuz why not   I promise it will be great   will do my good   lol     my only blame be why I haven t decide to play this soon   p
sow seed in the ground   harvest potato   sow seed in your wife   harvest kid   life be a giant farm
 
I be so busy to water my virtual plant that my real one almost die
who need a real wife   kid   dog   farm and friend when you have sdv   this game fill the void in my heart   damn I m lonely     but at least I pixelate cheek I can clap         would jpg again
this be one of the good game to come out in        such a breath of fresh air that a game like this have do so well   and prove on so many level that a game with a simplistic premise like this be still desire by so many people   one of the only indie game I can think of that release in a what could be consider   finish   state   even though the game itself be still be update and new addition have be add   also this game be make over the course of many year by one guy   which be absolutely amazing to I   money well spend
I cancel my wow subscription to have more time to play this game   its awesome
j
easily one of my favourite game I ve ever play and I always find myself come back to play it
a wizard force I to do drug so I could be one with the land
although I do not like the fact that the game doesn t have an option to kill my girlfriend s ex   sebastian   I propose to to my gf in a submarine and she say yes   so it be still a       
you play as a worker who get sick of your city life and get land in a countryside from your pass away grand father    game play wise it be pretty much like harvest moon   but with some touch that make this game unique and different from it   you be free to play the game as you want   you can farm   forage stuff from the nature   mining   fishing   or even kill some monster to get loot as source of your income    there be a some boy and girl to flirt with to be marry and have family with   mysterious stuff and magical thing happen in this country side   stardew valley   which make the game more interesting   there be a lot of cut scene as you progress so you get hook by the valley    the game be constantly update by its developer   truly a labour of love from the developer after all this year   there be a lot of mod to apply too if you would like to
now this be an amazing game   in my opinion   it s far well than harvest moon and nearly as good as rune factory   I have enjoy this game with and without mod   the cost be reasonable   and I would gladly pay it to support the one person who create it   the game itself be awesome   the story and event in the game be fun and cute   there s so much to do   the character be amazing   and they be so different from each other   just because it s mostly farm doesn t mean you have to be a farmer   you could be a fisherman   a monster hunter   or just forage for loot   anyway   I would highly recommend this game   and I m sure if you play it   you would too
honestly   in my view   stardew valley be more for a niche audience   especially those who appreciate old school charm   I play it just to tick it off my gaming experience list   and because of its fascinating development story   which be cover by jason schreier and which you might not know    eric barone live off his girlfriend s income while they struggle to make end meet   rent a modest house with friend   all while his family doubt the project s success   yet   through four year of determination   he teach himself everything from code to art and music   create what become an indie sensation and a modern tribute to harvest moon   his dedication result in a game that have since captivate player around the world    after stardew valley gain popularity   eric barone   the game s creator   have the opportunity to meet yasuhiro wada   the original creator of the series   this meeting be significant   as wada have be an inspiration for barone during his development of    when they meet   wada express admiration for barone s work and how he have successfully revitalize the farming sim genre   this encounter be a touching moment for barone   as it feel like a full circle experience his childhood inspiration acknowledge his hard work and success    I like such kind of story   such case be crucial for understand game   the nuance of the industry   and the involvement of individual creator and their dedication   they highlight how personal sacrifice and passion for beloved game can drive innovation and inspire future generation of developer   as a mental result   be the only game where you can leave your soul crush corporate job to find inner peace by     grow parsnip   it s part farm   part small town gossip simulator   where your tough decision be whether to plant cauliflower or finally talk to the brood guy at the saloon    I feel my time hasn t come yet to fall in love with this game   and I believe   that time will come one day    for I and for now   it s more about the story of the game than the game itself
stardew valley be an absolute treasure of a game that I ve have the delight of experience on various console   this farming rpg have not just win I over   it s become a time devour vortex of joy   gift I countless hour of pure gaming bliss    let s talk visual first charming and nostalgically craft   reminiscent of the golden age of     bit graphic   the pixel art s attention to detail be nothing short of breathtake   and the lively color practically breathe life into the stardew valley universe    now   let s dive into the gameplay a captivate journey where you inherit a dilapidated farm and set out on a quest to resurrect it from its sad state   the ability to tailor your farm   sow crop   tend to animal   and weave intricate relationship with the townsfolk be strangely gratify    what set stardew valley mile apart from run of the mill farming simulation be its profound depth and diverse range   it s a virtual playground   offer a myriad of activity   whether you re dig for precious resource in the mine or peacefully cast a line into serene lake   with every season   new challenge and opportunity arise   ensure the gameplay be a constant dance of freshness    and then   the soundtrack a symphony of perfection   the tranquil melody seamlessly meld with the game s calm atmosphere   turn routine task like tend to crop into a euphoric experience    in summary   stardew valley isn t just a run of the mill farming rpg   it s a sensational masterpiece that have ensnare I across different gaming platform   with its enchanting visual   addictive gameplay   and a smorgasbord of activity   it s a non negotiable play for genre enthusiast   whether you re a seasoned farming veteran or a newbie to the scene   this game guarantee a cascade of immersive and fulfilling gameplay

reminiscent of the harvest moon game   I ve really enjoy this one   I ve put in too many hour   lose a lot of sleep and mess up my social life up more than it already be with no end in sight    there s different kind of farming in the game include ranch   you can make your own artisanal good include wine   beer   jelly   jam   cheese etc   and eat they yourself   give they as gift or sell they for a profit   you can forage for different type of plant in the wild   you can fish all you want in river   lake and the ocean   you can go deep into the mine for ore need to upgrade your farming equipment   just be careful of monster and bring a sword   there s even an experience system so you can level up and choose profession that well fit your playstyle   be it for livestock or for your field   fishing or trap and so on   and if all that wasn t enough   there s close to     people in town you can interact with   each with their own little event and story   marriage be an option too with    bachelor and    bachelorette to choose from each with their own unique personality   there s so much more and it s just amazing to I that this game be make by    guy and not a team    for I   this game come out of nowhere and have become a surprise hit   I recommend it for everyone   even if you don t think it s your kind of game   try it anyway   you can always refund it within    hour provide you don t lose track of time

sebastian be hot
     hour on this game so far   and more come   let s see what I learn    you can sell an emerald for      g and a pizza for      g    to make someone like you   you will have to give   em ton of gift   nothing else   just give they gift    some of the villager consider diamond   the bad gift possible    your horse and dog don t need food and water to survive   but your chicken cow etc do    there be more easter egg and secret than the amount of braincell I get        
pc s alternative to harvest moon   perfect time waster with relax atmosphere and lot of content    as of write this review   I have     h on record and still haven t see everything the game have to offer   and I m still enjoy what I have see so far   there s also suppose to be multiplayer mode release in a patch later   so keep your eye out on that    absolutely worth its price   can t think of any flaw besides control   which be only kinda wonky if you play with kb m   and abysmal with controller   you d get the same experience with use joy key    but controller support might change consider the recent console release
romanticize pastoral life    stardew valley start with a relatively cut and dry plot that throw you in the middle of an inherit farm   the basic loop of the game start out with you clean up the farm   plant crop and try to figure out what the town be about   that in itself be enough and hit home for I personally   as I too be privy to the ideal of escapism to get away and live off the   fat of the land    the game so far feel like a simple game about farming but soon add another layer    keep up friendship and try to fix up the town to its past glory   but it doesn t stop there it keep go with each pass season thing change people personality evolve and open up along the way    you find a mine   you discover fishing    all of which be repetitive mundane task to say the least but this game s sleep and seasonal cycle doesn t let you dwell on one thing for too long and nudge you towards improvement   but of course you have choice    you can attend that festival or let it go   keep farm   fishing or mining everyday or potentially have a more balanced experience   the game very rarely force your hand into do something rather it nudge and suggest    I m still work my way through the game but   if you want to decompress and chill out   give it a try   you will know within a loop of a day or two   if this be your cup of tea or not
pro    harvest moon like gameplay    the bag be large than harvest moon    can step on crop   mostly     can dig trash when you re hungry    many kind of foragable good and fish    fishing minigame be challenge    funny event   interesting plot    monster hunt     quest     con    I lose my weekend

a uniquely addictive game that I be surprised to say I didn t like   this be without a doubt a very high quality   excellent game   but if you be the kind of person that get easily stress out by a pack to do list   this game might not be for you   I be constantly focus on how to get to the next objective and the next   I think that s a strong suit for folk who want a game with a lot of challenge to overcome   but for I too stressful because time management matter in stardew valley
this game make I sad because my character be successful and happy and be date a nice young girl and I unintentionally compare it to my own real life and now I have a low type of temporary depression     great game though   wholesome   beautiful   fun   remind I of when I be a kid and play   harvest moon back to nature   on playstation      also hat off to concernedape for single handedly craft a masterpiece
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
I m not a big fan of review   and I rarely give my opinion about the game I usually buy   but     this one deserve it    I can remember of my sweet childhood     when I use to have a ps    and I could play harvest moon   back to nature on it   yeah   I be pretty addicted to the game   but     unfortunately   one day   my console crash   I feel bad   and     ugh     I didn t want to play anything anymore    so   when I get a computer   I discover the magic world of the emulator   then   I realize I could revive the good ol   day play harvest moon   back to nature   I download the stuff   and start to play the game   with a controller   to make it more nostalgic    too bad it hasn t the same taste as before   I didn t want to play it with the same vigour as before    so   last monday           a friend that I make at my new college   recommend this game   he say I could buy it without any regret   and you know what   he be right   I sell some of my most precious tf   item in order to buy this game     but it worth the risk   I get something way more precious   this game   and now   I can have some of the taste I be look for since my ps   crash long time ago    so   if you like an   old school   game with a countryside thematic   like harvest moon   I strongly recommend it   I gurarantee you win t regret spend your money on this game       a little update   I ll nominate it for the   good use of a farm animal   award    p another update   now   nominate to the   the labor of love   award    pp another one update   again   nominate   but now   for   well with friend   award    ppp yet another update   nominate again   now for another   the labor of love   award    pppp   yeah   I ll never get tired of this   another   another   update   yeah     year nominate this game for something   nominate again   for another   labor of love   award    ppppp another another another update     year and count   here we go    labor of love   again    pppppp another another another uhh another update     year of   labor of love    let s keep go    ppppppp another another another bruh another aaaaand     another update     year    labor of love    here we be again   let s do this    pppppppp
the rightful successor to harvest moon    a high quality farming   and more    game which   despite the small budget and    man developer team   continue to get meaningful update and addition   just look at what s in store for version        recommend without any reservation
this review be a tad overdue   I have praise this game to my friend for the past       year   I can t remember when I get this game exactly   but I know I don t regret log      hour into it    I grow up love harvest moon   play as much of it as I could   no   this isn t an hm carbon copy   it s something uniquely its own   and know I   I d search and scour each secret this game have   and there be a lot   it s not just till a field   plant a turnip   and wait a few day for profit   it continue beyond that    this be a calming game to grab when you re have a bad day   or like I   writer s block     so if you want a game that have an awesome soundtrack   a great love community   and countless hour of gameplay   this be for you    not go to lie though   after a while it do become a money farm   but that s only if you do everything   that can not be help and I m not complain about it

stardew valley be a mighty fine harvest moon clone for a pc   and on the pc that be have be dry as a desert   it s a must buy if your be a harevest moon fan   if you be not     well it s still a very good game that can swallow hundred of hour   there be plenty of thing to do   farming   mining   fishing   forage   ranch   besides that you can socialize with people   you can make beautiful farm or one that bring in heap of cash everyday   try co complete challenge as fast as possible or take your time
you should buy this because it s worth every penny   I be never the type to like   resource management   or   non intense pvp   game until I play stardew   it s easy to write off as a minecraft   terraria type game   but once you play it you realize the genius behind stardew   it have element of roleplay   it allow you to be creative in a challenging way   and you have different event to look forward to year after year   yes   after awhile   it can get repetitive     but that s where the mod come in   stardew be incredibly easy to use mod on   even if you get bored of play vanilla stardew   you can explore other aspect of vanilla like the other farm   some challenge   adjust the money margin   etc   there s so much to do in this game and always not enough time   and I think that even if you stop play this for year   it s not difficult to imagine you d play it again    it s one of the few game you d rarely regret purchasing as it s be around      year now since I ve have it     stop play it for around a year   and come back to it with joy and vigor
I be a     yo father   probably one of the old people play this game   I be a single far to my son   who be     now   my son get this game for christmas in       from his uncle   so we instal it on his computer and he start play   by the end of the week he have     hour on this game   this be horrible for I   as it be already hard for I to find way to spend time with my son   as he be always out with his friend or just watch youtube   so I decide to make a steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside he   I load into the game   pick my character and start play but I be stick on what you where suppose to do   I ask my son for help and he host a game for I to join   I love it as it be the good time I have spend with my son since my wife have die   this game have ever since bring I and my son close again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well   this game remind I that there s fun to be have in everything   and it have bring both I and my son many happy memory
you want a farm sim   there s your          farm sim   you want some well graphic   fuck you   in stardew valley   there s lot of stuff   for example   multiplayer   no   it s not just an additional workforce   you can play along with other player in festival   you can even marry other player or even same gender marriage   do harvest moon let you do these     play stardew valley     for all you people that enjoy harvest moon   play this one too   it cover almost everything harvest moon can offer   plus more     x   square layout be so        seed be no long spread in   x    and you can walk through crop    except crop that grow with trelli      well   all farm sim be grindy   you first get some seed to plant   water it   and sell the crop   then you buy seed with the money you get   plant it   water it   sell it   repeat    yes   it s grindy   but it s fun   enjoyable   and for the lack of a well word   addictive   I     just can t explain why   some people even get to play more boring game   like idle game   why be that   I don t even know    it s harvest moon   but  
   it s the moment to review this gem   I never like pixel art game   farming game and all that bunch   I ve be gift this game from a friend and I wasn t sure at the beginning   I ve actually play it for trust   and it be a great idea   it s an addictive game   full of mystery and cuteness    honestly   even after     hour I haven t have enough yet     grab it even at full price
I can not even express how much I love this game   nor can I easily define why I love it   it take I by surprise   really   with the bright colour and pixel art   I expect     I don t know what I expect   but I surely didn t expect to sink     waht         hour in the first week play it   I m try to pace myself   but whatever else I do   I m think about stardew valley    it s charming   funny and have a bit of everything   story   combat   family life   collection   unlockable area   fishing   make friend   mining and let s not forget farm    every season be different   so you have to pay very close attention to the calendar I e   how many day until the change of season   if I plant these crop will they mature before the change of season kill they    the calender be also vital for keep track of whose birthday be next   every villager like different thing so I do lean heavily on the wiki to keep track of the good gift to give they for maximum relationship gain   but I be learn a few favourite    there be no combat in the regular area of the map   but when you feel the need for some dungeoneere there be       level of an abandon mine shaft   every     level have a change of environment   leafy frosty dark etc   in the mine and of course an increase in danger and reward   I m only down to level     so far and besides the combat one of the great danger be stay out too late and fall asleep    it take I a little while to get the hang of the combat system   but it start out easy and once I realise that it s time base and I learn the rhythm I find it pretty enjoyable   fishing be also time base and start out hard   if fishing be get you down I recommend just do it    not worry about catch anything    until your character level up fishing   once I gain a few level and learn the mechanic it s a very fun minigame    the save system and many of the random event be tie into the night time sleep   so you have to be in bed by   be   if you aren t your character will pass out and will awaken in their own bed or in the hospital   but will be moderately penalise for it   the game will give you a reason for how you return to your bed and lose thing   there be a few variation   it s a frustrating mechanic in some way   but it do add to the whole planning aspect   so it s not actually a gripe    I do have a slight gripe that save only happen when sleep   but the day be quite short   so it s only be a few time when I ve not be able to quit at the time that I want   my hour be inflate slightly by I leave the game run if I need to do something and I m not at a point where I can save   though    stardew valley have so many feature and the many   many detail of all those feature be far too many to list   I didn t think that I could get into a game with pixel art graphic   but I m glad that I give it a go   everything about stardew valley have totally win I over   it s even win I over to the idea of pixel art graphic in general    that s enough of a review from I   I need to go and play some more         recommend
this thing be so good   I be keep awake at night itching to get back on it   and the morning after have to fight myself to leave the house so I wouldn t spend the next      business day build the coop
buy this game at full price be basically rip the devs off        
boy help I out   my wife say if I get      like and     award   she ll buy I a new pc with a rtx      ti and a crate of beer this be not a joke   
if there be a game make with heart   its this one   what can I say   rpg farm minigame in one   trust I   you must play it to see how amazing this be   it be like diamond pack in paper from candy   you must unpack it to see how good it be
I ll try to keep my review short and spoiler free   this game be good and you should get it          concernedape have hit a homerun with this one   the charming farming backdrop be only the beginning as you take over your grandfather s dilapidate farm   if you go into the experience fully   you ll enjoy meet and befriend a complex little community by the sea   you can be as altruistic or evil as you choose   and even though the player rarely offer dialogue   the writing be often good enough to provoke at least the thought of a roleplay response   or you can just farm wheat all summer and fall and make million off of your own craft brew and never even talk to a townie besides your source of seed   all back by surprisingly diverse yet coherent soundtrack   also make by concernedape    absolutely check this out if you be look for charm   character   and a place to absolutely sink a lot more time than you intend    I have lot of additional time on console
honestly   I m not a farming game typa guy   if you look at my library this game stand out like a sore thumb   but I get it to play with my girl who love these type of game and let I tell you   this game be surprisingly fun to play   the game be very well make   and it s likely go to be the only game of it s genre that doesn t melt my mind with boredom   hell   it might be the only game of it s kind that I ll play period    why   well   I don t really know   I know I enjoy the game   I know I and my girl can lose entire day to this game   but I can t point to a specific reason as to why   which be why I say it s very well make   all of the different part may seem meh on their own   but the way with which they be bring together be what make it such a lovely experience    the combat be simplistic   the watering control be confuse   and after the first year or two you ve do most of the basic and practically finish the game   but   I still find myself excited to play this game   its relaxing   monotanous in its chore   and it give a certain sense of accomplishment see your crop sell for a mil after you ve stockpile for an entire season    all in all   I give this game an        the watering issue be absolutely infuriate at time   but honestly   that s the big complaint I ve get
be a deep fan of terraria   well   I guess       hrs of gameplay be enough to call it so      I be very sceptic at first and decide not to try this one on summer sale        but     after watch some playthrough on youtube I decide to give it a try   the result   my beloved terraria be forget for a while   and this little beauty be nominate for the   the even well than I expect   award    need I say more    just play it   terraria fan    that s more relax   more lovely   more cute    if one may say so   though it have a strict timeline    it do not bring tense feeling   surely it s not ideal   but as it be     well   it s impressive and surely something that be create with passion and dedication of one man   worth the money spend to the penny   and on top of that    every minute spend for play it      can t wait to replay again when update      be live   guess this will be my   th playthrough    
I love this game   if you re date someone   and you like game where you can do in game grind   then get this game    it s so fun to do thing like   farming   mining   building   expand land etc    even if you re by yourself   this game be also fun to play   the npc be fun to interact with   and I think you can marry they too if you get enough heart   happy farming    
one of the good game in steam   it be a game that you live with   eat with   and be addict to   in my opinion   it be the good game of all time   if it be a girl   I would marry she                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  I will eventually update this review as I play through it far   however I want to write something at this point in time     at first glance this could be mistake for your standard indie title that s fairly cheap and have a fair bit of hype   however this be genuinely one of my new favourite game to play   I have not delve as far as I possibly can into this game yet it have satisfy I endless amount    the game be base around the idea that you be a rookie farmer inherit a farm from your grandfather and that be the main centre of the plot with a loose story that you follow as you grow throughout the game    it be separate into four season   spring   summer   fall   winter   which each have     day   each season have a mechanic where you can grow certain crop and each crop have a certain amount of time it take to grow   which keep the game from become stagnant and overly repetitive   I personally enjoy the variety of what you can grow as it be fun to be able to select what you want to harvest and manage over the come season   each season also have numerous event   I e fall have a halloween base event towards the end of month   which add an exciting presence to the game   which encourage you to keep track of where you be in the month and add more depth to the valley    you have the ability to fish   which at first be a mechanic which catch I by surprise as it actually require patience and concentration   not something you d expect from a fairly passive game like this   it be not terribly difficult to get a hang of however and result in a fine way to pass the time   your luck can either result in a variety of capture be it fish   or random assortment of trash from seaweed to break cd    another way to spend your time be by forage or mining or collect resource   you can venture out on your farm and utilise your array of tool to collect wood from tree   destroy large rock to collect stone   dig for random loot   or come across wild berry or other fruit to sell or use for health energy   you have the option to proceed and make your way down a mine in the valley   which have a large amount of floor   with increase difficult as you go down far   this mine be arguably the good part of the game outside of the harvesting as it make for a minimalise dungeon crawl experience in a rather warm game   I enjoyed sprawl in this mine collect mineral that can be use to improve my tool   random gem that can be sell   and defeat enemy and monster that make the experience troublesome    npc in the game be a big factor   and there s a number of they from which you can interact with   each npc have an approval rating from which you can develop relationship with   a lot of these character have cutscene where you can learn about they and which bring character development to a type of game which wouldn t necessarily have such a feature   these relationship must be further through the giving of gift   however each npc have their own preference to what item their like and dislike   which make this feature a lot more complex and vary   I think this add a fine layer to a game which otherwise wouldn t have have this kind of depth   whilst also employ fine narrative and interesting characterisation   one final thing to note   be that you have the option to do quest for these npc   such as give they ore   or other item in general   with vary level of difficulty   these lead to monetary or other gain   whilst also improve the relationship between the player and the npc    another feature I d like to cover in this review   be the ability to create bundle   this feature be unlocked as you gain access to the community centre   which be rather break down and old   to improve and fix this building   you must finish bundle   which can be from anything to collect a certain group of fish   to donate a certain amount of money   this will give you reward   or access to new locale and feature within the game   thus encourage you to seek out the requisite item to finish these bundle   this further the game and will encourage to keep play for a long while   especially completionist as they look to gain      percent    you have the ability to also play this game with multiple other   in up four player   include yourself    this be the perfect game to play with other people as you can work together towards the goal of make a nice and profitable farm    the only negative I can conjure up in term of this game be a few bug that will no doubt be rectify in future update   in certain instance whilst play multiplayer   the person I have be play with have be stick in a certain motion   I e a fishing motion    and also I ve be able to gain more ore from a stone than possible if I be to break it at the same time as another playing be mine it    to summarise   underneath the surface of this quaint and charming game   there be a lot to do and a lot to see   and it be honestly one of my favourite game so far this year   I be really glad that I start to play this as it have offer I an alternative to money grub competitive game such as counter strike   whilst I can also put in a lot of time and dedication to something to which feel rewarding to I   I would fully encourage you to play this   and especially with other people
don t buy this game because it be make by one man   don t buy this game because it remind you of harvest moon   don t buy this game because it have pixel graphic   buy this game because it be great
after a few day a wizard give you lsd    good game
yes
stardew valley be an amazing game   I haven t even play much and you can simply see by play    or so hour of the game how much the game have to offer   when look at any gameplay of the game   it look like it might just be a glorified mainstream farming simulator   but I will tell you it have so much more to offer   some of these thing that the game include be     relationship with people   a hack and slash mining experience   economic selling and buying and even a little bit of story   now   I ll go ahead and go over some personal pro and con for stardew valley    pro     allow an insane amount of playtime and it d take a while to feel like you ve fully complete the game     the game look absolutely stunning for it s pixel look     it s playable on potato computer     the game have an upcoming co op mode that be suppose to come out sometime during the summer of          the character and resident in game be pretty well think out and have good characteristic and personality    con     update be slow come   grant the team for this game be quite small     the game can feel a bit slow at the start     sometimes the game can feel like you re in an endless loop of do the same exact thing everyday     co op keep getting delay    overall   I d have to recommend this game and I          love it   I ve push people to get the game as well as I have buy it for people   I d say buy this game
        can t play anymore because it take over my life
I ask a girl to dance with I   she respond    ew   no           realistic          would get reject again
   I need to say a few thing about this game   first of all   stardew valley be an awesome simple game   even though I be a bit lost when I play it the first time   since my friend get it too   it turn into one of the good game in our life   we spend million of hour into this game and every time when we think we be go to reach the end soon   we discover a whole new world   stardew valley make we live a life of perfection   it curse our depression and make we to the proud and lucky human being   we be owner of a perfect farm   tbh it look a bit ugly because my friend always throw accidently bomb around   but this doesn t matter now   the reason I write this review be two thought that I can not get rid of and I need to express my feeling    one of my thought be about junimo kart   my friend accidently accept the mission where we have to reach        point   we spend so many hour try to reach the score   but fail the whole time   we need to start the day new so many time and every time we try it again it make we even madder   we get so frustrated that we start talk about jesus   we find out that this actually help and the game be kind of fun while talk about it   but the frustration of not reach the score after day and day be big   we be so helpless that we ask a friend   who reach the score then instantly with the word   easy    which become the climax of our frustration    another point be linus            I hate this creepy guy   I find it kind of strange that doesn t matter where or when I die or fall asleep linus be always the guy who find I and if this be not enough he steal my money and all my precious item   even our galaxy sword and other unique weapon   he be the reason why I be scared now to walk alone around in the dark in stardew valley    do not get we wrong we be still huge fan of this game   we just need to let out our feeling    
follow our curator page   ocg curation if you like and want to see more review like this one    overview   stardew valley be   on the surface   a simple farming simulator   however   upon start your new life as a farmer   you realize there be a variety of task and challenge worth seek and overcome   this will be expand upon later    despite this be the case   stardew valley maintain a stance of be a game where the player may play at their leisure   the atmosphere that this game provide be one of relaxation   and act as a very nice break to whatever other game you may be play       the gameplay of stardew valley be the essential bread and butter of this game   though it be rather casual in nature   the game provide such a unique variety of activity that it s hard to not do something at least somewhat productive   the core of the game can be surmise into six category   five of which be skill you can enhance and level up by perform the activity    the first and most obvious one be farm   once you start the game   your first instinct be to go to the store to purchase seed for you to grow as crop for your farm   and not without good reason   among the five activity   farming be the one most people will rely on to obtain a steady flow of fund so that they can move on to big and great thing   upgrade building   buy animal   etc     tend to your crop be essential as you re only equip with a watering can and hoe   however   it all begin worth it once it become time to harvest   pluck each fruit and vegetable have its own charm and can cause you to buy even more seed so that you may harvest even more crop    the second be forage   this can be accomplish through pick up wild berry   break and collect rock   or chop up tree for wood   this be the other field you will likely be focus on early in the game as your farm land will initially have have many weed to cut   and tree to chop so that you can make space for your crop to go in   however   even after clean it once doesn t mean that it s over as these thing respawn on the farm at the start of every season   keep you on your toe if your especially tidy about how you want your farm to look   gather material like wood and stone be essential as they be require for many upgrade you will be seek in the future    the third skill be fish   soon after start you will be give a fishing rod   the addition of this item be what will initially start to bring more variety to your everyday in game life   there be a fair amount of body of water for you to select from   and naturally fish in different area can cause you to capture different kind of fish   fish can also contribute to your income   but what truly shine about fishing be that it introduce some of the more difficult challenge the game have to offer   in the realm of fishing there be a special breed of fish know as the legendary fish   which needless to say be a cut above all the other fish you will catch   though not a requirement   challenge such as this be what keep game entertaining to I    fourth we have my personal favorite   combat   that s right   you re a monster fighting farmer   though the combat system isn t particularly complex   the simplicity of just be able to fight against monster really add to stardew valley s unique flavor   this can actually be couple with the fifth and final skill   mining   similar to the receiving of the fishing rod   access to the mine will later become available   as well as a much more challenging location that can be unlocked later on in the game   these mine be where you will primarily obtain your assortment of artifact and mineral   stone   copper   iron   etc     these mineral be essential to upgrade your gear so that your everyday life as a farmer can be make easy   however   the mine be also home to the many creature of stardew valley   so you win t be bore just hack away mindlessly at deposit of ore    that do it for all the skill you can hone and polish throughout the game   but like the legendary fish   there be many other thing to focus on in the game if you seek completion   make friend   and even romance character let the game sort of act like a date sim   although most friendship mark will increase base on an item you give they as a gift   however   character you can marry will provide special cut scene as well dialogue option at certain milestone   so a quest of love also exist   the final major factor of this game be the community center where bundle can be contribute to   these bundle will consist of the fruit of your hard labor   literally   these bundle will require you to procure the high quality of crop   a variety of monster drop   different specie of fish   and more   by complete this sort of checklist   you can gain access to whole new area fill with adventure   there be also many thing to unlock and see even without the community center    there be another way to obtain access to these area that require a large amount of fund     but most   in my experience   will avoid do so    overall   there be just so much to do in this game   it s quite hard to ever become bored   in fact   depend on the person   this game can become incredibly addict and as a result become an incredible time sink    I will mention now   that there be still several factor in the game I haven t bring up which add to the game   but I feel that the point I bring up be consider the most important     a lot of the magic of this game come from how soothing and well suit the music be to it   you understand this from the moment you load the game and go to the main menu   the music may not be on a grand scale   but it s certainly memorable   sound effect from do simple thing like chop wood or pick up a fruit be very simple   however   I see this as a part of the game charm with it s pixel graphic     what you see be what you get   from the screenshot of the store alone you can see that this be a game that use pixel graphic   there may be those that be a bit tired of see so many game adopt this style in today s day and age   but with stardew valley I truly feel that it be fitting for the game in how simplistic the mechanic be   yet how deep the game can get in term of what to do and how to do it     the game doesn t require much to run as it be   and so perform with absolutely no issue for I   however   there be noticeable issue of lag in regard to the beta for multiplayer out right now     the one thing this game need be already be work on   and that s a way to play with friend   the multiplayer be currently in beta however the issue aren t severe   quite frankly   buy the game for multiplayer alone right now would be well worth it      possess great replay value   simple in design   complex in practice   variety of fun thing to do whenever   many quest to complete   romance option aren t limit to the opposite gender   great aesthetic and music to back it up     multiplayer have issue in its current state   pierre close on wednesday
it good
you take care of potato          goty    if you have ever play harvest moon   ie   friend of mineral town or other    it be exactly that    if you have not   here s a short description   you have a farm   plant vegetable in it   take care of your farm animal   harvest and sell   you can also dig in a mine   go fishing   do some minor quest for npc   and upgrade your farm   sound meh   but you don t get how fun it be until you play harvest moon or this game   there s always something to do   and the gameplay be definitely not monotonous   at least if you win t make it so    this be a game that might deliver countless hour of fun   stardew valley also offer different farm type at the beginning   albeit you start play and play one game for dozen or hundred of hour   so it might take a while until you actually bother to check different one    I mean   there s actually not much to write about this game   it s just fun to play   I haven t encounter any bug so far   so from technical standpoint it s really good    if you have never play harvest moon before   you should give stardew valley a try   if you have   then you exactly know what to expect

bruh I love fish
this game   or should I call it masterpiece    be the epitome of labor of love
this game bring some much need joy to my currently very sorrowful life   I m a city kind or person   but somehow stardew valley convince I to purchase a small lot of land to build a farm on   when I m old    I m play this game mostly on my phone   some day I could play for a few hour   some other day I could only spend a few minute to have a glance at my farm   but it s enough   as whenever I open the game   just listen to the music and look at pelican town   I feel happiness    I buy this on steam to show some support to the developer    again   very nice background music   suit the game perfectly   nice mix of farming and rpg   just the right level of complexity   it s not the most complicated game out there but you would be surprised at its depth   I don t have much detail to say about the gameplay   many other people have review the game thoroughly    more expansion   more content be welcome       
good rpg game play ever   play it again during the coronavirus quarantine day and I ve finally figure out the main story of stardew valley   what s funny s that I ve be ignore the mission and task in the first profile   about      hour in total    and just consider it a simulation game   while play my second character   what impress I most s that stardew valley have such significant story plot   the npc   as I use to consider as   all have their own character and background   they feel embarrassed be catch hang out with other   they feel hurt be cheat   they come out of their mind verify whether their ex wife live well   they be exactly like one of we   and honestly   I don t feel like play a game call   stardew valley    but the one call   the sim     the only question s that   when will the dev update next time    
when I first hear about stardew valley   I be reasonably certain that it would be an utterly hateful imitation of its obvious inspiration   the harvest moon series   thankfully   as be often the case where labor of love be concerned   I could not have be more wrong   and it s clear that solo developer concernedape be as keen to enhance and expand upon the farming simulator blueprint   to that effect   stardew valley take the basic formula of run and revitalize a dilapidated farm   socialize with townsfolk and produce good for sale   and introduce craft   fighting   questing and a variety of other feature to flesh out the overall experience    the basic gameplay be very similar to that of the harvest moon game   albeit with a more broad selection of animal and vegetable to produce   stardew valley allow the player to develop and expand at their own pace across a perpetual timeline   but it doesn t offer much by way of hand hold   you ll quickly learn how to do obvious thing like till the earth   plant seed and water the seedling   but there be plenty to discover through read item description or watch television   in the game    other thing must simply be learn through trial   error and common sense   not a lot in stardew valley happen by accident   so should you decide to bend your will to a particular pursuit   you can always be reasonably certain of a predictable outcome   the one area where this be not strictly true be in socialise with other townsfolk   but more on that later    here s what I like    still water run deep    cute and accommodate as it may appear to be   stardew valley be a game with incredible depth   many dedicated pc gamer have sink hundred of hour into the game   and I have no doubt that xbox one player will do the same   and still win t have see everything that the valley have to offer   agricultural farming feature load of plant and vegetable to choose from   each of which have different requirement for growth and harvesting   the same can be say of livestock farming   which feature numerous animal and ensure that the player consider their need carefully before make the investment   that s just the tip of the iceberg though   and player can also fish   or seek out forage throughout the valley   or they can simply delve into one of several cave to locate valuable ore and mineral   wherever the player source the basic material   there be many way to increase the value of the product that finally ship to market   include   for example   make beer   or artisan pickle and jam   then there be craft   the social system   which be a bit limited   as you ll read below   and countless other thing to sink your time into    sweet as honey    once you become engross in stardew valley   it become incredibly difficult to put the pad down   a day play out like this   you ll get up at about        and no matter how big your farm   you ll probably complete the basic farming duty by about         you ll be happy with that though   because as soon as you re into the swing of thing   you ll have an agenda of your own anyway   you ll already be plan your hunt for wild garlic   or aim to get to the fifth level of the dungeon with the new sword you craft the night before   it s incredibly addictive   and refer back to my previous comment about the depth of the game   I can t imagine how any two playthrough would go the same way   beside the application of similar good practice for choose and grow early game veg   for example   because as soon as you find the spark that set you off on a particular path   you will want to bend your will to see that path through to the end     antisocial network    when interact with townsfolk in stardew valley   it be unfortunate that the game offer only basic   cryptic dialogue which all lead to the same outcome   if you give people stuff they want   then they will like and ultimately fall in love with you   marriage and potentially child can follow   should you wish   in a game as detailed as stardew valley be in all other area   the social system feel lack   and it be verge on offensive to think that in        you can simply   buy   yourself a husband or wife by give they shiny stuff   this be one area where the game miss completely in my opinion   and I simply haven t feel incentivise to follow through on the social aspect of the game in the same way as I do with the rest    change season    this be a relatively minor criticism because I have few   but because the game be so broad   it be hard to reach a definitive endgame in stardew valley   there be certainly plot line   such as marriage   house upgrade or agricultural success   that you could consider to be major event   and there be some other more traditional quest completion milestone that I win t spoil here   but the game be hard   if not impossible   to finish   you could definitely achieve one or two major goal over several week of play   but I m not sure how long it would take to achieve all of the notable completion event    probably forever     I often complain about game that be shallow or short and expensive   which be a major pet hate of mine   when it come to stardew valley   I feel the opposite   this game be          but it should be       or even       the game be vast   detailed and nearly impeccable in every way   with perhaps only the social element lag behind the rest   it be every bit as feature pack as the aaa rate game that it be similar to   such as harvest moon and animal crossing   I ll be play stardew valley for a long time to come   and I genuinely hope that this review inspire you to pick it up and do the same   because this be one of the fine example of passionate   empower independent video game make I ve ever come across
love it      I ve put more than      hour at this point and it s mostly in one year and I think that speak for itself

good game to escape the depressing reality and act like you have people that like you and feel like you ve get your life together good game
stardew be crack level addict
I can say a lot of pretty good stuff about this game   but I will try to itemize    pro     minigame be great and varied    there be a lot of thing you can do    each   playthrough   should be relatively   short    there be an event after the first two year that most people count as be the end of the game   though you can keep play   also   you need quite some real life hour for each playthrough     good replayability since you can choose different map for your farm and take different path as you play   con     you will probably end up loose some hour of sleep since time will fly while play this game     you have be warn
outstanding base builder    open world game   I put off purchase at full price   but it really be so worth it   the game ingeniously hide deep game mechanic behind a seemingly simple interface   and it quickly become a new obsession   once I understand that I could explore in whichever way and in whatever pace   like a good story   I find layer to be discover   which reward a leisurely examination    I be use ubuntu linux        with a xbox type gamepad controller   there be some very minor gamepad control issue   but I have not experience any other technical problem   the game engine be   actually not rpgmaker   develop in mono   with     and     bit executable    not go to say much more about the game experience   for this popular game   I simply encourage any fan of base building game to take a close look   even past the cute sy presentation    one update   the game do stumble mid game with some half baked fishing and combat mechanic   unfortunately    stardew valley drop you into your new home   give you a place in the storyline   and make you feel like a member of the community   there be always more to do than hour in the day   and it will be your decision on how to make the most of it

I work on a farm live in a perfect town have the perfect trad wife everything be great   then I wake up
farm
this game be practically   cocaine mix with crack harvest moon on steroid this game will make you   lose your girlfriend and get a virtual one   haley    quit your job to tend your blueberry crop say one more day just one more day      and the thought of all this be the doing of one man be unbelievable this game be worth every dime
one of my favorite   I have hundred of hour log on the switch version   the character all have their own interesting personality and story   the gameplay loop be very addict   collect everything to create recipe to create more thing   just can t stop   the music be phenomenal   there isn t one single bad thing I can say about this game    I would recommend this outright to any and everyone   so much more than just a farming sim   I can t wait for haunted chocolati
I think what make this game so good   and perhaps so popular   be that it strike the perfect balance   it be a simple farming sim   social town sim   old school dungeon crawler   very simplified    and an achievement hunter s dream   none of the aspect of the game ever reach a point where they feel tedious or pointless   at no point do any one goal feel like it be unachievable   or that the time or work to make it happen outweigh the end result    stardew valley give you just enough mini goal at just the right frequency   you can take it as slow or as fast as you like   you be never punish for change your mind about what goal to work on and the game be build in such a way that you can juggle several goal at a time without too much difficulty   I love be free to follow the game s quest and suggest task or to ignore they entirely   I can interact with the villager   court they   make friend with they or ignore they completely without penalty   each of the segment of the game   farming   mining combat   socialize   collect item   be just simple enough to invite you to learn they thoroughly and just complex enough to be interesting without get to the point of feel grindy    I should mention that I never play any of the harvest moon game   but I do play animal crossing on the wii   this game share a similar feel in the social aspect of animal crossing   but lack the deep penalty in that game   in animal crossing if you fail to visit town people regularly or give they gift they will get upset and move away      I would highly recommend this game to anyone who play casual farming sim   social town sim   this game would also work well for people who like be hand small   easily achieveable quest at an easy pace or who want to be able to change the type of play style at a moment s notice   great for those who want enjoy constant change of pace  
it feel pretty pointless to write another positive review to add to stardew s           other have rave in detail about all the great element of this game   so I ll just add that I have nearly        hour at the time of writing and I still only have      of the steam achievement   this be a game with so much depth that I actually feel bad for only having pay      for it   it s worth   x more   easily
an inviting   peaceful   addictive experience where you will want to just play more day every day   the fact that one person make this be astounding   recommend it to several friend who have all end up surpass I in hour   lot of fun for everyone
this game teach I that stand outside a girl s room until she leave and gift her jar of mayonnaise be the way to her heart         would stalk with mayonnaise again
I play this for      hour in a week     that say more about the game than I   I swear  
the good indie game of my life   p   freedom         fun         level of difficulty       even the first person can play fun    
this game man   it s like beat ur meat for the first time u don t know what ur do but it feel good
I have never invest so much time into a simulator style game   follow these step for an excellent experience       make a serious file for all your seriously serious decision      get your fill   then make another file and mod the tar out of it      get your fill   then make another serious co op file and get one of those friend people      get your fill   then mod the crap out of that co op file without warn your friend and laugh hard over their reaction      quit the game and realize you play over      collective hour of it      love concernedape with all your heart
there be a reason why stardew valley remain to be one of the only farming life sim with   overwhelmingly positive   rating on steam for so long   the only other one be field of mistria afaik   and that game be still in early access    it s your classic farming sim that expand everything yet still keep the soul of the classic harvest moon game    it doesn t have as deep of a combat rpg mechanic of rune factory   it doesn t become another take of the genre   which be awesome too   like the   my time at   game   it have those element   yet still retain the soul of the classic farming sim genre   plus with the recent      update   there s not a well time to jump into this game   it s the most complete expand classic farming sim you can get on steam   do every single thing so well to near perfection   it s mind boggle to think it be even develop by a single guy    and of course it s the ultimate handheld steam deck game
pro     first   if you ever play harvest moon or any other similar game   I truly recommend this game   and maybe you will like this game     if you never play any harvest moon game or any similar game   hmm   I don t know how to describe it   this game be about farming   fishing   mining   take care of your livestock   time management   socialize with people in village   know each of their story   help they   etc    make friend   fall in love with someone   fight some monster   etc   in other word how to live your life in a village    fun   enjoyable and addictive game once you know basic mechanic of the game     high replayability    replay value     multiplayer mode be come soon    con     never ever put your horse directly in front of your shipping box   chance you can t mount ride your horse again in that day   but   you can mount ride your horse again in the next day   in game day     I don t know this be con or not   the in game time go by a little bit fast     hour in game    around     second in real life    you can t do or finish multiple task in the same day   maybe it s part of the game mechanic   time management    overall   I really recommend this game       
really   really   really addictive   then you get to about year    and wonder what s leave to do     definitely worth the        so I figure out what you do when you get bored   go play another game until depression hit   then go back to stardew and do it all over again
just great   I could not stop play   have play without break     hour   I be not unemployed    for I everything be just perfect   the ideal relax after work   grow crop   raise animal   explore   skill and craft with beautiful music and sweet graphic   it will simply never get bored there be always something to do   I be very happy with the game
I know this review be go to sound like all the other review but     if your suffering from any kind of mental health issue   I strongly recommend this game    as someone who have and be still suffer from anxiety   this game really help   it suck you away from the real world and make you forget everything happen around you    please go show this developer some love by buy this game
